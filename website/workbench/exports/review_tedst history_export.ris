T1  - Effect of race on the glycaemic response to sitagliptin: Insights from the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS).
N2  - AIM: Pooled efficacy studies suggest that glycaemic responses to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes are greatest in Asians, who may also respond better to alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. We assessed the glycaemic impact of sitagliptin by race in the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS), and whether this was enhanced in Asians with concomitant acarbose therapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: TECOS enrolled 14 671 patients with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and HbA1c of 48-64 mmol/mol (6.5%-8.0%), and randomized them, double-blind, to sitagliptin or placebo. There were 3265 patients (22.3%) from Asian countries. Background glucose-lowering therapies were unaltered for the first 4 months post randomization unless clinically essential, facilitating comparison of sitagliptin-associated effects in self-identified East Asian, Other (South) Asian, White Caucasian, Hispanic, Black and Indigenous groups., RESULTS: Median baseline HbA1c by race was 54 to 57 mmol/mol (7.1%-7.4%). Mean 4-month reduction in placebo-adjusted HbA1c was greatest in East Asians (-6.6 mmol/mol [-0.60%] vs <=6.0 mmol/mol [<=0.55%] in other groups), with significantly greater reduction vs the 2 largest groups (White Caucasians, Other Asians; P < .0001) after adjustment for covariates. After the first 4 months, East and Other Asians were more likely to initiate additional oral therapy (metformin and/or sulfonylureas) than insulin vs White Caucasians (P < .0001). Acarbose use increased in the Asian patients, but no glycaemic interaction with allocated study medication was observed (adjusted P = .12)., CONCLUSIONS: The greatest initial reduction in HbA1c with sitagliptin in the TECOS population was in East Asians. No enhanced glycaemic effect was seen when sitagliptin was given with acarbose. Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T1  - Comparison of glucose-lowering agents after dual therapy failure in type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
N2  - AIMS: To assess the evidence supporting the choice of third-line agents in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and July 2017 that reported data on cardiometabolic outcomes and hypoglycaemia for glucose-lowering agents added to metformin-based dual treatments. Data were stratified by background therapy and RCT duration, and synthesized, when possible, with network meta-analyses., RESULTS: A total of 43 RCTs (16 590 participants) were included, with metformin combined with: sulphonylureas (SUs) in 20 RCTs; thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in 10; basal or rapid-acting insulin in 6; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in 3; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in 2; and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in 2. When added to metformin and SUs, after 24 to 36 weeks, rapid-acting insulin resulted in the largest reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; 1.6% vs placebo), followed by GLP-1RAs (1.0%), basal insulin (0.8%) and SGLT-2 inhibitors (0.7%), with no difference between GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors; body weight increased with insulin treatment (~3 kg vs placebo), while the greatest reduction was observed for SGLT-2 inhibitors compared with all other therapies. Limited data for hypoglycaemia indicated a similar risk for SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs. Results for third-line agents added to metformin and TZDs were comparable, showing similar HbA1c reduction and risk of hypoglycaemia between SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, and a slightly greater reduction in body weight with SGLT-2 inhibitors vs GLP-1RAs. Data for 52 to 54 weeks were more limited: added to metformin and a SU, TZDs, GLP-1RAs or SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced HbA1c to a similar extent but had different effects on body weight (7 kg and 5 kg more with TZDs vs SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, respectively; 2 kg less when comparing SGLT-2 inhibitors with GLP-1RAs). Formal analyses could not be performed for any other dual therapy failure combinations because of the small number of available RCTs., CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-quality evidence supports the choice of a third-line agent only in patients on metformin combined with a SU or a TZD, with SGLT-2 inhibitors performing generally better than other drugs. In suggesting third-line agents, future guidelines should recognize the widely differing evidence on the various dual therapy failures. Copyright Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T1  - Short-term intensive insulin as induction and maintenance therapy for the preservation of beta-cell function in early type 2 diabetes (RESET-IT Main): A 2-year randomized controlled trial.
N2  - AIM: To test the hypothesis that the addition of periodic courses of short-term intensive insulin therapy (IIT) could enhance the effect of metformin (MET) maintenance therapy on preservation of beta-cell function following induction IIT., METHODS: In this multicentre, randomized controlled trial, 108 adults with type 2 diabetes (median 1.3 years' duration; HbA1c 6.6% +/- 0.6%) were randomized to 3 weeks of induction IIT (glargine, lispro) followed by MET maintenance, either with or without periodic 2-week courses of IIT every 3 months for 2 years. Beta-cell function was assessed by the Insulin Secretion Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) at an oral glucose tolerance test every 3 months., RESULTS: In both arms, induction IIT increased ISSI-2, improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and reduced hepatic insulin resistance (all P <= .0004). The primary outcome of baseline-adjusted ISSI-2 at 2 years was not improved by the addition of intermittent IIT (MET + IIT) and was slightly higher in the MET arm (baseline-adjusted difference -35 [95% CI: -66, -3]), with three additional beta-cell measures showing no significant differences. Baseline-adjusted HbA1c at 2 years did not differ between MET and MET + IIT (6.3% +/- 0.1% vs. 6.4% +/- 0.1%, P = .46), with 32.6% of participants in each arm maintaining HbA1c of 6.0% or less at 2 years., CONCLUSION: Although initial induction IIT induces metabolic improvement, subsequent repeat courses of IIT every 3 months do not further enhance the effect of MET maintenance therapy on beta-cell function.

T1  - Effects of Non-insulin Anti-hyperglycemic Agents on Gut Microbiota: A Systematic Review on Human and Animal Studies.
N2  - Background: As growing evidence links gut microbiota with the therapeutic efficacy and side effects of anti-hyperglycemic drugs, this article aims to provide a systematic review of the reciprocal interactions between anti-hyperglycemic drugs and gut microbiota taxa, which underlie the effect of the gut microbiome on diabetic control via bug-host interactions. Method: We followed the PRISMA requirements to perform a systematic review on human vs. animal gut microbiota data in PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases, and used Cochrane, ROBIN-I, and SYRCLE tools to assess potential bias risks. The outcomes of assessment were trends on gut microbiota taxa, diversity, and associations with metabolic control (e.g., glucose, lipid) following anti-hyperglycemic treatment. Results: Of 2,804 citations, 64 studies (17/humans; 47/mice) were included. In human studies, seven were randomized trials using metformin or acarbose in obese, pre-diabetes, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Treatment of pre-diabetes and newly diagnosed T2D patients with metformin or acarbose was associated with decreases in genus of Bacteroides, accompanied by increases in both Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Additionally, T2D patients receiving metformin showed increases in various taxa of the order Enterobacteriales and the species Akkermansia muciniphila. Of seven studies with significant differences in beta-diversity, the incremental specific taxa were associated with the improvement of glucose and lipid profiles. In mice, the effects of metformin on A. muciniphila were similar, but an inverse association with Bacteroides was reported. Animal studies on other anti-hyperglycemic drugs, however, showed substantial variations in results. Conclusions: The changes in specific taxa and beta-diversity of gut microbiota were associated with metformin and acarbose in humans while pertinent information for other anti-hyperglycemic drugs could only be obtained in rodent studies. Further human studies on anti-hyperglycemic drugs other than metformin and acarbose are needed to explore gut microbiota's role in their therapeutic efficacies and side effects.

T1  - The effect of exenatide on fasting bile acids in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, a pilot study.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) demonstrated good glycemic efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) recent years, whereas studies on GLP-1 RAs' biliary effects were limited. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of exenatide on bile acids (BAs) and investigate the role of BAs in the glycemic control effect of exenatide., METHODS: Thirty-eight newly diagnosed T2DM participants without glucose-lowering drugs intake were recruited. Plasma total bile acids in fasting state (FTBAs) and other parameters were tested at baseline. Then exenatide were applied to the T2DM participants for 12 weeks. FTBAs and glycemic parameters were measured again after exenatide treatment, and correlation analysis between changes of FTBAs and glycemic parameters were conducted to investigate the role of BAs in the glycemic control effect of exenatide., RESULTS: The baseline FTBAs level of T2DM patients had no significance (3.84 +/- 2.06 vs. 3.87 +/- 2.89, P = 0.954) compared with healthy subjects. After 12-week exenatide treatment for the T2DM patients, FTBAs were decreased from 3.84 +/- 2.06 mumol/L to 3.06 +/- 1.27 mumol/L (P < 0.01). The correlation analysis showed that changes of FTBAs was positively correlated with changes of FPG (r = 0.355, P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated a decreased FTBAs level after exenatide treatment for 12 weeks, without the interference of metformin and other glucose-lowering drugs. The reduction of FTBAs might not exert a positive role in the glycemic control effect of exenatide., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial registration number: NCT04303819.

T1  - Early combination therapy delayed treatment escalation in newly diagnosed young-onset type 2 diabetes: A subanalysis of the VERIFY study.
N2  - We analysed glycaemic durability (sustained glycaemic control) with early combination therapy (metformin plus vildagliptin) versus metformin monotherapy, among patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed before (young-onset [YOD]) and after (late-onset [LOD]) the age of 40 years, enrolled in the VERIFY trial. The primary endpoint was time to initial treatment failure (TF), defined as HbA1c of 7.0% or higher at two consecutive scheduled visits after randomization. The time to secondary TF was assessed when both groups were receiving and failing on the combination. A total of 186 (9.3%) patients had YOD and 1815 (90.7%) had LOD with a mean age difference of 20.4 years. Compared with metformin monotherapy, early combination reduced the risk of time to initial TF for both YOD (48%, P < .0006) and LOD (46%, P < .0001). With early combination, risk for time to secondary TF was reduced by 48% (P < .0035) in YOD and 24% (P < .0009) in LOD. Both treatment approaches were well tolerated with no unexpected safety concerns. In treatment-naive patients with YOD (HbA1c 6.5%-7.5%), an early combination strategy improved attainment of the glycaemic target with durability and delayed treatment escalation compared with initial metformin monotherapy.

T1  - Protocol for the CHORD project (community health outreach to reduce diabetes): a cluster-randomized community health worker trial to prevent diabetes.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) affects 9.4% of US adults and children, while another 33.9% of Americans are at risk of DM. Health care institutions face many barriers to systematically delivering the preventive care needed to decrease DM incidence. Community health workers (CHWs) may, as frontline public health workers bridging clinic and community, help overcome these challenges. This paper presents the protocol for a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial integrating CHWs into two primary care clinics to support DM prevention for at-risk patients., METHODS: The trial will randomize 15 care teams, stratified by practice site (Bellevue Hospital and Manhattan VA), totaling 56 primary care physicians. The study cohort will consist of ~ 2000 patients who are 18-75 years of age, actively enrolled in a primary care team, able to speak English or Spanish, and have at least one glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) result in the prediabetic range (5.7-6.4%) since 2012. Those with a current DM diagnosis or DM medication prescription (other than metformin) are ineligible. The intervention consists of four core activities - setting health goals, health education, activation for doctor's appointments, and referrals to DM prevention programs - adjustable according to the patient's needs and readiness. The primary outcome is DM incidence. Secondary outcomes include weight loss, HbA1C, and self-reported health behaviors. Clinical variables and health behaviors will be obtained through electronic medical records and surveys, respectively. Implementation outcomes, namely implementation fidelity and physicians' perspectives about CHW integration into the clinic, will be assessed using interviews and CHW activity logs and analyzed for the influence of moderating organizational factors., DISCUSSION: This is the first rigorous, pragmatic trial to test the effectiveness of integrating CHWs into primary care for DM prevention reaching a population-based sample. Our study's limitations include language-based eligibility and the use of HbA1c as a measure of DM risk. It will measure both clinical and implementation outcomes and potentially broaden the evidence base for CHWs and patient-centered medical home implementation. Further, the intervention's unique features, notably patient-level personalization and referral to existing programs, may offer a scalable model to benefit patients at-risk of DM., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03006666 (Received 12/27/2016).

T1  - SITAgliptin for Depressive Symptoms in Type 2 Diabetes: A Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: We tested the feasibility of using sitagliptin-a dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor-for depressive symptoms in type 2 diabetes (T2D)., METHODS: In a feasibility, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, we recruited people aged 18 to 75 years with T2D (glycated hemoglobin A1c levels >=53 and <=86 mmol/mol prescribed oral hypoglycemic therapy) and comorbid depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score >=10) from family practices in South London. Eligible patients were randomized to sitagliptin 100 mg per day or matched placebo for 12 weeks. The primary feasibility outcomes were participation rates, attrition rates, and adverse events. The primary clinical outcomes were depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology scores) at 12 weeks as assessed using analyses of covariance. Ranges of treatment effects were estimated using Cohen d and associated 95% confidence intervals, where negative values favored sitagliptin over placebo., RESULTS: Of 153 people screened across 32 practices, 44 were randomized (22 to each arm). The mean (standard deviation) age was 58.8 (8.3) years, 46% were female, and 52% were of non-white ethnicity. Of those treated, 1 patient (4.5%) in each arm withdrew, and there were no group differences in adverse events. Despite improving 12-week glycated hemoglobin A1c (d = -1.19 [95% confidence interval = -1.90 to -0.48), improvement in 12-week Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score with sitagliptin was inferior to placebo across the range of estimated treatment effects (d = 0.71 [0.13 to 1.30]). Effects of sitagliptin on inflammation were inconsistent (d = -0.32 [-0.81 to 0.17] for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein)., CONCLUSIONS: Repositioning of oral hypoglycemic therapy for depressive symptoms in T2D is feasible. However, in this unpowered feasibility study, we did not detect evidence of superiority of sitagliptin over placebo. The results are cautioned by the small sample size and limited treatment duration.Trial Registration: EudraCT: 2015-004527-32. Copyright Â© 2021 by the American Psychosomatic Society.

T1  - Abrogation of postprandial triglyceridemia with dual PPAR alpha/gamma agonist in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
N2  - AIMS: Lowering postprandial lipemia may mitigate cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia. This study was aimed to investigate whether saroglitazar suppresses postprandial lipemia in patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia., METHODS: This was a 12-week, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of saroglitazar in patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia. Thirty patients were randomized (1:1) to receive saroglitazar 4 mg or placebo orally once daily with metformin for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in plasma triglyceride (TG) area under the curve (AUC) on a standardized 8-h fat tolerance test., RESULTS: Thirty participants were randomized for interventions and eventually data of 19 participants qualified for per protocol analyses. Mean (SD) age in saroglitazar was 53.1 (8.8) years and 54.9 (7.7) years in placebo group. After 12 weeks, saroglitazar significantly lowered postprandial TG-AUC by - 458.3 (144.0) (- 25.7%, 95% CI - 765.1 to - 151.4) versus an increase of + 10.9 (157.9) (+ 0.5%, 95% CI - 325.6 to 347.3) mg/dL h in placebo group (P < 0.05). Saroglitazar lowered postprandial TG incremental AUC versus placebo: - 329.4 (89.9) (- 59%) versus + 80.4 (99.4) (+ 10%) mg/dL h (P < 0.05). HbA1c (%) decreased by - 0.36 (0.42) in the saroglitazar group as compared to an increase of + 1.26 (0.46) (P < 0.05) with placebo., CONCLUSIONS: The saroglitazar treatment significantly improved postprandial TGs in people with diabetic dyslipidemia., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trial Registry of India; trial Registration No.: CTRI/2015/06/005845 and Date of registration: June 02, 2015.

T1  - [Metformin treatment of antipsychotic-induced dyslipidemia: analysis of two randomized, placebo-controlled trials].
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety for metformin in treating antipsychotic-induced dyslipidemia. Methods: Two randomized placebo-controlled trials were included in the analysis. A total of 201 schizophrenia patients with dyslipidemia after treatment with an antipsychotic were collected, and the patients were divided into two groups: a 1 000 mg/d metformin group (n=103) and a placebo group (n=98). The clinical symptoms and metabolic indicators such as body weight, blood glucose, and blood lipids were assessed at baseline, the 12th week and the 24th week after treatment respectively. Results: After metformin treatment, the mean difference in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) value between the metformin group and the placebo group was from 0.16 mmol/L at baseline to -0.86 mmol/L at the end of the 24th week, which was decreased by 1.02 mmol/L (P<0.01). At the 24th week, the LDL-C was more than 3.37 mmol/L in 25.3% patients in the metformin group, which was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (64.8%) (P<0.01). Compared with the placebo group, there were significant changes in the weight, body mass index (BMI), insulin, insulin resistance index, total cholesterol and triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the metformin group (all P<0.05). The treatment effects on weight and insulin resistance appeared at the 12th week and further improved at the 24th week, but the effects on improving dyslipidemia only significantly occurred at the end of the 24th week. Conclusion: The metformin treatment is effective in improving antipsychotic-induced dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, and the effect to reduce the antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance appears earlier than the effect to improve dyslipidemia.

T1  - Type 2 Diabetes Therapies: A STEPS Approach.
N2  - A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

T1  - A Prospective Analysis of the Efficacy and Safety of Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors: Real World Evidence from Clinical Practice in India.
N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The number of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing. Most patients with T2DM are uncontrolled and fail to achieve their target Hba1c. In recent years, newer agents such as SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been approved for clinical use. Though data from clinical trials and sub set analysis of Indian patients in global studies are promising, real world evidence from standard clinical practice in India is lacking. The aim of this study was to analyze the metabolic parameters in patients with T2DM on SGLT2i in real world clinical practice., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective, longitudinal study of 100 patients with uncontrolled T2DM attending the outpatient of a specialized diabetes hospital. Their metabolic parameters were evaluated at baseline and after 3 months of follow up. They were categorized based on their baseline anti diabetic medications into four groups (25 in each). The groups were as follows: metformin plus sulfonylurea, metformin plus DPP4 inhibitor, triple drug regimen with metformin plus DPP4 inhibitor plus sulfonylurea, and patients on insulin and on triple drug therapy with metformin plus sulfonylurea plus DPP4 inhibitor. Patients in each group were initiated with an SGLT2i. Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out using Microsoft excel. T test was used to calculate the p value at 5 % level of significance., RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects in the study population was 53.20+/-12.1 years and the duration of diabetes was 13.1+/-7.26 years. The mean Hba1c reduction and weight reduction observed was 1.02+/-0.24% and 2.64+/-1.27 kg respectively. Genital pruritis was reported in 4% of the patients. There was a 16.6% reduction in the daily insulin requirement at follow up when compared to baseline. No other side effects were observed. The reductions in Hba1c and weight were statistically significant (p<0.05) across all groups., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that when SGLT2i are added at any stage of the disease spectrum with any of the preexisting therapeutic agents for patients with uncontrolled T2DM, there is an improvement in glycemic control and body weight, with minimal side effects. The real world study data on Indian patients appears to be promising.

T1  - Budget Impact of Oral Semaglutide Intensification versus Sitagliptin among US Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Uncontrolled with Metformin.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Oral semaglutide was approved in 2019 for blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and was the first oral glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). T2DM is associated with substantial healthcare expenditures in the US, so the cost of a new intervention should be weighed against clinical benefits., OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the budget impact of a treatment pathway with oral semaglutide 14 mg daily versus oral sitagliptin 100 mg daily among patients not achieving target glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level despite treatment with metformin., METHODS: This study used the validated IQVIA TM CORE Diabetes Model to simulate the treatment impact of oral semaglutide 14 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg over a 5-year time horizon from a US healthcare sector (payer) perspective. Trial data (PIONEER 3) informed cohort characteristics and treatment effects, and literature sources informed event costs. Population and market share data were from the literature and data on file. The analysis evaluated the estimated budget impact of oral semaglutide 14 mg use for patients currently using sitagliptin 100 mg considering both direct medical and treatment costs to understand the impact on total cost of care, given underlying treatment performance and impact on avoidable events., RESULTS: In a hypothetical plan of 1 million lives, an estimated 1993 patients were treated with sitagliptin 100 mg in the target population. Following these patients over 5 years, the incremental direct medical and treatment costs of a patient using oral semaglutide 14 mg versus sitagliptin 100 mg was $US16,562, a 70.7% increase (year 2019 values). A hypothetical payer would spend an additional $US3,300,143 (7.1%) over 5 years for every 10% of market share that oral semaglutide 14 mg takes away from sitagliptin 100 mg. Univariate and scenario analyses with alternate inputs and assumptions demonstrated consistent results., CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral semaglutide 14 mg in patients currently receiving sitagliptin 100 mg substantially increases the budget impact for patients with T2DM whose blood glucose level is not controlled with metformin over a 5-year time horizon for US healthcare payers.

T1  - Exenatide with Metformin Ameliorated Visceral Adiposity and Insulin Resistance.
N2  - BACKGROUND: To study the effectiveness of exenatide with metformin and sequential treatment with exenatide and glargine added to metformin and their influence on insulin sensitivity and adipose distribution., METHODS: 20 newly diagnosed obese type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled, and 2-month washout treatment of metformin, 6-month exenatide treatment, and 6-month glargine treatment were administrated sequentially accompanied with previous metformin. Glucolipid metabolic parameters were compared among groups. Adipose distribution was quantified with computerized tomography according to anatomy, dividing into visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), adding up to total adipose tissue (TAT)., RESULTS: The 6-month exenatide treatment dramatically ameliorated the glucose and lipid profile, improved insulin sensitivity, and mainly decreased VAT and also the ratio of VAT/SAT (RVS). The following 6-month glargine treatment increased VAT. The whole 12-month sequential treatment with exenatide and glargine added to metformin basically improved the insulin sensitivity and glucolipid control though VAT rebounded at the end, however without deteriorating the other parameters., CONCLUSION: Exenatide is an ideal treatment for obese type 2 diabetic patients in the aspect of adipose tissue distribution. Sequential treatment of exenatide and glargine could be an alternative for low-income patients who cannot afford GLP-1 agonist for long time. This trial is registered with ChiCTR-OOC-17013679.

T1  - Rationale and design of study of dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin treatment efficacy on prevention of cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes patients: the DIVERSITY-CVR study.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies reported that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduced the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to placebo in contrast to no reduction with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors. However, there are no comparative studies on the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors on HbA1c, body weight and hypoglycemia as risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present ongoing study is to compare the effects of dapagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, with those of sitagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, on cardiovascular risk factors in T2DM patients with inadequate glycemic control., METHODS: The study of dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin treatment efficacy on prevention of cardiovascular risk factors in T2DM patients (DIVERSITY-CVR study) is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, parallel-group, comparative study. A total of 340 T2DM patients treated with metformin alone or with no glucose-lowering agents (hemoglobin A1c >= 7.0 and < 10.0%) will be randomized into the dapagliflozin group (5-10 mg/day, n = 170) and the sitagliptin group (50-100 mg/day, n = 170), and treated for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the rate of achieving a composite endpoint of the following three items at 24th week; (1) HbA1c < 7.0%; (2) body weight loss of >= 3.0% from baseline; (3) avoidance of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia will be monitored using the flash glucose monitoring system. The secondary outcomes include each component of the primary endpoint, plus indices of lipid metabolism, and evaluations related to safety., CONCLUSIONS: There is lack of solid information on differences in the therapeutic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors on multiple risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. It is anticipated that the results of the DIVERSITY-CVR study provides useful clinical data on the management of patients with T2DM, including reducing the risk of CVD. The results of this study will become available in 2019. Trial registration University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN000028014). Registered 30 June 2017.

T1  - Henagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin: A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.
N2  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of henagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled with metformin., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This multicentre phase 3 trial included a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period, followed by a 28-week extension period. Patients with a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) to 10.5% (91 mmol/mol) were randomized and treated with once-daily placebo (n = 161), henagliflozin 5 mg (n = 162), or henagliflozin 10 mg (n = 160). After 24 weeks, patients on placebo were switched to 5 mg or 10 mg henagliflozin for the additional 28-week treatment, and patients on henagliflozin during 24-week treatment period maintained this initial therapy. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24., RESULTS: At Week 24, the least squares mean HbA1c changes versus placebo from baseline were - 0.76% (-8.3 mmol/mol) and - 0.80% (-8.7 mmol/mol) for henagliflozin 5 and 10 mg, respectively (all P < 0.0001). Compared with the placebo group, both doses of henagliflozin lowered fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose, body weight and blood pressure, and increased the proportions of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) at Week 24. The trends in these improvements were sustained over an additional 28 weeks. Slightly higher proportions of ketosis and presence of urine ketone bodies were observed in patients treated with henagliflozin compared to placebo at Week 24. No diabetic ketoacidosis or episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were reported., CONCLUSIONS: Henagliflozin 5 mg or 10 mg as add-on therapy to metformin provided a new therapeutic option for the treatment of T2DM patients who have inadequate glycaemic control with metformin alone, and was generally well tolerated.

T1  - Efficacy of iGlarLixi in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled (glycated haemoglobin >=8%, >=64 mmol/mol) on two oral antidiabetes drugs: Post hoc analysis of the LixiLan-O randomized trial.
N2  - AIMS: To assess the efficacy and safety of iGlarLixi (the titratable fixed-ratio combination of insulin glargine 100 U/mL [iGlar] plus lixisenatide [Lixi]), in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels >=8% (>=64 mmol/mol)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The LixiLan-O study (NCT02058147) compared iGlarLixi with iGlar or Lixi in adults with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin +/- a second oral antidiabetes drug (OAD). This exploratory analysis evaluated the LixiLan-O subgroup of participants with baseline HbA1c levels of >=8% (>=64 mmol/mol) who were receiving metformin plus a second OAD at screening., RESULTS: The mean diabetes duration was 10.0 years, and the mean duration of second OAD use was 4.5 years. iGlarLixi demonstrated greater mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c and 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) compared with iGlar or Lixi (HbA1c -1.9% vs. -1.6% or -1.0% [-20 vs. -17 or -10 mmol/mol; 2-hour PPG -7.2 vs. -4.6 or -5.5 mmol/L). Greater proportions of participants achieved HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) with iGlarLixi versus iGlar or Lixi (67% vs. 51% or 18%), and the composite endpoints of HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) with no body weight gain (36% vs. 19% or 16%), and HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) with no body weight gain and no documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose <=3.9 mmol/L; 28% vs. 15% or 15%). The incidence rates of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia were 29.0%, 27.9% and 12.1% for iGlarLixi, iGlar and Lixi, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Adults with T2D and HbA1c >=64 mmol/mol (>=8%) despite two OADs at screening achieved better glycaemic control with iGlarLixi versus iGlar or Lixi, without increased risk of hypoglycaemia versus iGlar.

T1  - Combination GLP-1 and Insulin Treatment Fails to Alter Myocardial Fuel Selection vs. Insulin Alone in Type 2 Diabetes.
N2  - Context: It is unclear if effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and clinically available GLP-1 agonists on the heart occur at clinical doses in humans, possibly contributing to reduced cardiovascular disease risk., Objective: To determine whether liraglutide, at clinical dosing, augments myocardial glucose uptake (MGU) alone or combined with insulin compared with insulin alone in metformin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D)., Design: In a randomized clinical trial of patients with T2D treated with metformin plus oral agents or basal insulin, myocardial fuel use was compared after 3 months of treatment with insulin detemir, liraglutide, or combination detemir plus liraglutide added to background metformin., Main Outcome Measures: Myocardial blood flow (MBF), fuel selection, and rates of fuel use were evaluated using positron emission tomography, powered to demonstrate large effects., Results: MBF was greater in the insulin-treated groups [median (25th, 75th percentile): detemir, 0.64 mL/g/min (0.50, 0.69); liraglutide, 0.52 mL/g/min (0.46, 0.58); detemir plus liraglutide, 0.75 mL/g/min (0.55, 0.77); P = 0.035 comparing three groups, P = 0.01 comparing detemir groups to liraglutide alone]. There were no evident differences among groups in MGU [detemir, 0.040 micromol/g/min (0.013, 0.049); liraglutide, 0.055 micromol/g/min (0.019, 0.105); detemir plus liraglutide, 0.037 micromol/g/min (0.009, 0.046); P = 0.68 comparing three groups]. There were no treatment-group differences in measures of myocardial fatty acid uptake or handling, and no differences in total oxidation rate., Conclusion: These observations argue against large effects of GLP-1 agonists on myocardial fuel metabolism as mediators of beneficial treatment effects on myocardial function and ischemia protection.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin as an add-on therapy to sitagliptin and metformin in Korean patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized controlled trial.
N2  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin vs placebo as add-on therapy to metformin and sitagliptin in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)., METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, phase III study was conducted in Korea in 2015 to 2017. Patients were randomized to receive either ipragliflozin 50 mg/day or placebo once daily for 24 weeks in addition to metformin and sitagliptin. The primary endpoint was the change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to end of treatment (EOT)., RESULTS: In total, 143 patients were randomized and 139 were included in efficacy analyses (ipragliflozin: 73, placebo: 66). Baseline mean (SD) HbA1c levels were 7.90 (0.69)% for ipragliflozin add-on and 7.92 (0.79)% for placebo. The corresponding mean (SD) changes from baseline to EOT were -0.79 (0.59)% and 0.03 (0.84)%, respectively, in favour of ipragliflozin (adjusted mean difference -0.83% [95% CI -1.07 to -0.59]; P < .0001). More ipragliflozin-treated patients than placebo-treated patients achieved HbA1c target levels of <7.0% (44.4% vs 12.1%) and < 6.5% (12.5% vs 1.5%) at EOT (P < .05 for both). Fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, body weight and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance decreased significantly at EOT, in favour of ipragliflozin (adjusted mean difference -1.64 mmol/L, -1.50 muU/mL, -1.72 kg, and -0.99, respectively; P < .05 for all). Adverse event rates were similar between groups (ipragliflozin: 51.4%; placebo: 50.0%). No previously unreported safety concerns were noted., CONCLUSIONS: Ipragliflozin as add-on to metformin and sitagliptin significantly improved glycaemic variables and demonstrated a good safety profile in Korean patients with inadequately controlled T2DM.

T1  - Factors Associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treatment Choice Across Four European Countries.
N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this analysis was to identify factors associated with the choice of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) therapy at the time of intensification of antidiabetic treatment across 4 European countries., METHODS: Antidiabetic drug prescription/dispensing records and patients' characteristics were obtained from the electronic health care records of patients with T2DM from the Netherlands (NL), Italy, and Spain (ES) (all, 2007-2011); and the United Kingdom (UK; 2008-2012). Oral monotherapy was defined as first-line; oral dual therapy, as second-line; >2 oral treatments or oral combined with an injectable, as third-line; and injectables only, as fourth-line treatment. Treatment intensification was defined as the start of a higher line of treatment. Comedication, comorbidities, clinical parameters, and other factors associated with treatment choice were identified using multivariate relative risk estimation by Poisson regression with robust error variance., FINDINGS: In the 5-year study period, 485,120 patients (79% of the treated T2DM population) underwent treatment intensification. Changes in treatment choice were clearly visible over the study period, such as a decline in the use of thiazolidinediones (NL, ES, UK) and increases in the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) (NL, ES, UK) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (UK). With first-line treatment, advanced age and renal comorbidity were associated with the use of sulfonylureas (SUs; all countries), whereas high body mass index (BMI) was inversely associated with SU use in the United Kingdom and Spain. With second-line treatment, advanced age was associated with metformin + SU use (all countries); and renal comorbidity with SU + DPP4i use in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. High BMI was associated with metformin + thiazolidinedione (TZD) use in the United Kingdom and Spain, and with metformin + DPP4i in the United Kingdom. With third-line treatment, advanced age and renal comorbidity were associated with the use of SU + insulin (NL, ES, UK). Hemoglobin A1c >8.5% was positively associated, and high BMI was inversely associated, with the use of any third-line combination containing insulin. Across treatment lines TZD and metformin were negatively associated with renal and cardiac morbidity. Second and third line treatment choices strongly depended on prior treatments. With fourth-line treatment, women were more likely to receive glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists than were men in the United Kingdom and Spain., IMPLICATIONS: The results suggest that the main factors driving treatment choice at any stage of intensification were age, hemoglobin A1c, BMI, renal and cardiac morbidity, and treatment history. These drivers were consistent with guidelines on, and contraindications of, specific medications. Differences between countries were generally consistent with, but not solely attributable to, differences in local guidelines and reimbursement policies. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

T1  - Rationale and Study Design of a Randomized Clinical Trial of Metformin to Prevent Frailty in Older Adults With Prediabetes.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that leads to poor health outcomes with aging. Previous studies have demonstrated that insulin resistance and inflammation predict frailty onset. Metformin is a widely used, well-tolerated drug that improves insulin sensitivity and displays anti-inflammatory properties. It is also known to prevent diabetes onset in adults with prediabetes. We hypothesize that metformin in older adults with prediabetes will promote healthy aging and prevent frailty. Here we describe an ongoing placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial of metformin for the prevention of frailty in older adults with prediabetes., METHODS: Older adults aged more than 65 years are randomized to metformin or placebo and are followed for 2 years. Prediabetes, required for inclusion, is assessed by 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Exclusion criteria are baseline frailty (Fried criteria), diabetes, dementia, untreated depression, active malignancy, or severe cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurologic diseases. Primary outcome is frailty; secondary outcomes are physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery), systemic and skeletal muscle tissue inflammation, muscle insulin signaling, insulin sensitivity (insulin clamp), glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test), and body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry). Subjects are followed every 3 months for safety assessments and every 6 months for frailty assessment (Fried criteria) and oral glucose tolerance test, and every 12 or 24 months for secondary outcomes. Enrollment of 120 subjects (completers) will take place over a 2-year period., CONCLUSION: Metformin is being examined in this study as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent frailty in older adults with prediabetes. Findings from this trial may have future implications for the screening and potential treatment of prediabetes in older patients with metformin for the prevention of frailty.

T1  - Retrospective survival analysis in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus.
N2  - INTRODUCTION: The association between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) has long been evaluated and the role of antidiabetic medications such as metformin has also been investigated. The objective of this study was to examine the association between insulin use and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced PDAC and DM2., METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 164 patients, including an exploratory cohort of 96 patients from Medical Oncology Unit, University Hospital and University of Cagliari, Italy, and a validation cohort of 68 patients from Medical Oncology of Modena University Hospital. Patients had metastatic disease and received a first-line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and, subsequently, a second-line fluoropyrimidines-based chemotherapy. We performed univariate analysis to evaluate correlation between long-term diabetes and overall survival. Then we performed multivariate analysis, adjusting for sex, metastatic sites, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, Ca19.9 levels, N/L ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase levels at diagnosis, to confirm the independence of the variable., RESULTS: In the exploratory cohort, DM2 was significantly associated with higher median OS at univariate analysis (16 vs 10 months; p = 0.004). This result was confirmed by validation cohort (11 months vs 6 months; p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, insulin-treated patients compared with non diabetic patients showed a significantly increased survival of 4.6 months (p = 0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with insulin-treated metastatic PDAC showed better OS than non diabetic patients, as demonstrated by both cohorts. The correlation between OS and insulin-treated DM2 should be investigated further through a prospective clinical trial.

T1  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of metformin+dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors compared to metformin+sulfonylureas for treatment of type 2 diabetes.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) typically use several drug treatments during their lifetime. There is a debate about the best second-line therapy after metformin monotherapy failure due to the increasing number of available antidiabetic drugs and the lack of comparative clinical trials of secondary treatment regimens. While prior research compared the cost-effectiveness of two alternative drugs, the literature assessing T2D treatment pathways is scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) compared to sulfonylureas (SU) as second-line therapy in combination with metformin in patients with T2D., METHODS: A Markov model was developed with four health states, 1 year cycle, and a 25-year time horizon. Clinical and cost data were collected from previous studies and other readily available secondary data sources. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated from the US third party payer perspective. Both, costs and outcomes, were discounted at a 3% annual discount rate. One way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainty on the base-case results., RESULTS: The discounted incremental cost of metformin+DPP-4i compared to metformin+SU was $11,849 and the incremental life-years gained were 0.61, resulting in an ICER of $19,420 per life-year gained for patients in the metformin+DPP-4i treatment pathway. The ICER estimated in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis was $19,980 per life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results of the study were not sensitive to changes in the parameters used in base-case., CONCLUSIONS: The metformin+DPP-4i treatment pathway was cost-effective compared to metformin+SU as a long-term second-line therapy in the treatment of T2D from the US health care payer perspective. Study findings have the potential to provide clinicians and third party payers valuable evidence for the prescription and utilization of cost-effective second-line therapy after metformin monotherapy failure in the treatment of T2D.

T1  - Association Between the Use of Antihyperglycemic Drugs and Dementia Risk: A Case-Control Study.
N2  - BACKGROUND: There is a conflicting literature on the association between the use of antihyperglycemic drugs and dementia risk., OBJECTIVE: The goal of this case-control study was to analyze the association between the use of antihyperglycemic drugs and dementia risk in patients followed in general practices in Germany., METHODS: This study included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had received a first dementia diagnosis in 972 general practices in Germany between January 2013 and December 2017 (index date). Controls without dementia were matched (1:1) to cases by age, gender, index year, and physician. Two multivariate regression models were used to study the association between the use of antihyperglycemic drugs and dementia risk. Model 1 included all antihyperglycemic drugs prescribed to patients regardless of the prescription duration, whereas Model 2 only included the longest therapy prescribed to each patient., RESULTS: There were 8,276 diabetes patients with dementia and 8,276 diabetes patients without dementia included in this study. In Model 1, glitazones were associated with a decreased dementia risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.80), whereas insulin was associated with an increased risk of developing the condition (OR = 1.34). In Model 2, metformin, prescribed as monotherapy (OR = 0.71) or as dual therapy with sulfonylureas (OR = 0.90), was associated with a decrease in the likelihood of subsequently being diagnosed with dementia. By contrast, the combination of basal insulin and bolus insulin (OR = 1.47) and premix insulin (OR = 1.33) were risk factors for dementia., CONCLUSION: Metformin and glitazones were negatively associated with dementia, while insulin was positively associated with dementia.

T1  - Comparison of Surgical and Medical Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes in Severely Obese Adolescents.
N2  - Importance: Because of the substantial increase in the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in the pediatric population and the medical complications of this condition, therapies are urgently needed that will achieve better glycemic control than standard medical management., Objective: To compare glycemic control in cohorts of severely obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes undergoing medical and surgical interventions., Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis of data collected by the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) and Treatment Options of Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) consortia was performed. Teen-LABS enrolled 242 adolescents (<=19 years of age) from March 1, 2007, through December 31, 2011. TODAY randomized 699 participants (aged 10-17 years) from July 24, 2004, through February 25, 2009. Data analysis was performed from July 6, 2015, to June 24, 2017. Anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory data from adolescents with severe obesity and type 2 diabetes who underwent treatment with metabolic or bariatric surgery in the Teen-LABS study or medical therapy in the TODAY study were compared., Interventions: Teen-LABS participants underwent a primary bariatric surgical procedure; TODAY participants were randomized to receive metformin therapy alone or in combination with rosiglitazone or an intensive lifestyle intervention; insulin therapy was given in cases of progression of disease., Main Outcomes and Measures: Glycemic control, body mass index, prevalence of elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia, abnormal kidney function, and clinical adverse events were measured., Results: Data from 30 participants from Teen-LABS (mean [SD] age at baseline, 16.9 [1.3] years; 21 [70%] female; 18 [66%] white) and 63 from TODAY (mean [SD] age at baseline, 15.3 [1.3] years; 28 [44%] female; 45 [71%] white) were analyzed. During 2 years, mean hemoglobin A1c concentration decreased from 6.8% (95% CI, 6.4%-7.3%) to 5.5% (95% CI, 4.7% -6.3%) in Teen-LABS and increased from 6.4% (95% CI, 6.1%-6.7%) to 7.8% (95% CI, 7.2%-8.3%) in TODAY. Compared with baseline, the body mass index decreased by 29% (95% CI, 24%-34%) in Teen-LABS and increased by 3.7% (95% CI, 0.8%-6.7%) in TODAY. Twenty-three percent of Teen-LABS participants required a subsequent operation during the 2-year follow-up., Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with medical therapy, surgical treatment of severely obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes was associated with better glycemic control, reduced weight, and improvement of other comorbidities. These data support the need for a well-designed, prospective controlled study to define the role of surgery for adolescents with type 2 diabetes, including health and surgical outcomes.

T1  - Association Between Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors and Lower Extremity Amputation Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.
N2  - Importance: Results of clinical trials suggest that canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor for treating type 2 diabetes, may be associated with lower extremity amputation., Objective: To quantify the association between the use of oral medication for type 2 diabetes and 5 outcomes (lower extremity amputation, peripheral arterial disease, critical limb ischemia, osteomyelitis, and ulcer)., Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters data on new users between September 1, 2012, and September 30, 2015. The study focused on 2.0 million commercially insured individuals and used propensity score weighting to balance baseline differences among groups. Sensitivity analyses varied statistical models, assessed the effect of combining dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists as a single referent group, adjusted for baseline use of older oral agents, and included people with baseline amputation., Exposures: New use of SGLT-2 inhibitors alone, DPP-4 inhibitors alone, GLP-1 agonists alone, or other antidiabetic agents (sulfonylurea, metformin hydrochloride, or thiazolidinediones)., Main Outcomes and Measures: Foot and leg amputation, defined by validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Current Procedural Terminology codes., Results: Among 2.0 million potentially eligible individuals, a total of 953906 (516046 women and 437860 men; mean [SD] age, 51.8 [10.9] years) were included in the final analyses, including 39869 new users of SGLT-2 inhibitors (4.2%), 105023 new users of DPP-4 inhibitors (11.0%), and 39120 new users of GLP-1 agonists (4.1%). The median observation time ranged from 99 days for new users of GLP-1 agonists to 127 days for those using metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones, while the crude incident rates ranged from 4.90 per 10000 person-years for those using metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones to 10.53 per 10000 person-years for new users of SGLT-2 inhibitors. After propensity score weighting and adjustment for demographics, severity of diabetes, comorbidities, and medications, there was a nonstatistically significant increased risk of amputation associated with new use of SGLT-2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.85-2.67) and GLP-1 agonists (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.64-3.36). New use of SGLT-2 inhibitors was statistically significantly associated with amputation compared with sulfonylureas, metformin, or thiazolidinediones (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.19-3.77). These results persisted in sensitivity analyses., Conclusions and Relevance: Use of SGLT-2 inhibitors may be associated with increased risk of amputation compared with some oral treatments for type 2 diabetes. Further observational studies are needed with extended follow-up and larger sample sizes.

T1  - Patterns of glucose-lowering medication use in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure. Insights from the Diabetes Collaborative Registry (DCR).
N2  - BACKGROUND: Optimal glucose-lowering strategies in patients with both heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are not well defined, particularly as novel medication classes emerge. We sought to evaluate current patterns of glucose-lowering medication use in adults with T2D with and without HF., METHODS: The DCR is a US-based outpatient registry of adults with diabetes; currently includes 3074 providers in 203 practices. We used hierarchical, modified Poisson regression models to examine the relationship between concomitant HF with use of each glucose-lowering medication class, adjusting for other factors that could impact selection of one medication class over another: age, chronic kidney disease (CKD), coronary artery disease (CAD), number of glucose-lowering medications, and insurance., RESULTS: Among 456,106 adults with T2D, 125,161 (27%) had a diagnosis of HF (30% HFrEF, 15%HFmrEF, 55% HFpEF). Patients with T2D and HF were more likely to be older and male, and to have CAD, atrial fibrillation, and CKD. In the multivariable models, HF was associated with a greater use of insulin (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.36-1.42) and lower use of thiazolidinediones (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.74-0.83), SGLT2 inhibitors (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.79-0.89), and metformin (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82-0.86). Among the subgroup of patients with HF, thiazolidinediones, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors were used even less often in patients with lower ejection fraction, indicating that both the diagnosis of clinical HF and ejection fraction may influence the choice of glucose-lowering medications., CONCLUSION: In a large US-based outpatient registry, we found that a quarter of adults with T2D had a diagnosis of HF, which was predominantly HFpEF. Although certain T2D medication use in patients with HF appeared consistent with evidence (less use of thiazolidinediones), others appeared contrary to evidence (less use of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors).

T1  - Long-term observational study on the impact of GLP-1R agonists on lung function in diabetic patients.
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Preclinical research suggests a role of Glucagon Like Peptide-1 Receptors (GLP-1R) on the regulation of human bronchial tone. We investigated the effect of GLP-1R agonists on lung function of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) population without co-existing chronic obstructive respiratory disorders., METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study that examined change in lung function measurements over two years of T2DM patients (n=32) treated with metformin monotherapy (control cohort), metformin plus GLP-1R agonists (GLP-1R agonists cohort), or metformin plus insulin (insulin cohort)., RESULTS: After 24 months of treatment, the forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) significantly (p<0.05) increased from baseline in the GLP-1R agonists cohort (218ml [95%CI 88-246]), but not in the control and insulin cohorts (94ml [95%CI -28 - 216] and 26ml [95%CI -174 - 226], respectively; p>0.05 vs. baseline). The average increase in FEV1 in the GLP-1R agonists cohort was significantly greater than that in the control and insulin cohorts (delta: 110ml [95%CI 18-202] and 177ml [95%CI 85-270], respectively, p<0.05). The forced vital capacity (FVC) also increased significantly more in the GLP-1R agonists cohort than in the control and insulin cohorts (overall delta FVC: 183ml [95%CI 72-295], p<0.05). The maximal expiratory flow at 50-75% significantly (p<0.05) improved from baseline in the GLP-1R agonists cohort, but not in the control and insulin cohorts (p>0.05)., CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest a potential new therapeutic perspective to treat airway disorders with GLP-1R agonists.

T1  - A randomized clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin as initial oral therapy in youth with type 2 diabetes.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of DPP-4 inhibition with sitagliptin in youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D)., STUDY DESIGN: This was a 54-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of DPP-4 inhibition with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily as initial oral therapy in youth with T2D. The 190 participants, aged 10-17 years, had HbA1c 6.5%-10% (7.0%-10% if on insulin). All were negative for pancreatic autoantibodies and overweight/obese at screening or diagnosis. The trial was placebo controlled for the first 20 weeks, after which metformin replaced placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 20., RESULTS: Treatment groups were well balanced at baseline (mean +/- SD HbA1c = 7.5% +/- 1.0, BMI percentile = 97.1% +/- 6.8, age = 14.0 years +/- 2.0 [57.4% <15], 60.5% female). At Week 20, least squares mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were -0.01% (sitagliptin) and 0.18% (placebo); between-group difference (95% CI) = -0.19% (-0.68, 0.30), p = 0.448. At Week 54, the changes in HbA1c were 0.45% (sitagliptin) and -0.11 (placebo/metformin). There were no notable between-group differences in the adverse event profiles through Week 54., CONCLUSIONS: DPP-4 inhibition with sitagliptin did not provide significant improvement in glycemic control. In this study, sitagliptin was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to that reported in adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01485614; EudraCT: 2011-002528-42).

T1  - Combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin improves blood pressure and vascular function in type 2 diabetes.
N2  - AIMS: Preserved vascular function represents a key prognostic factor in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but data on vascular parameters in this patient cohort are scarce. Patients with T2DM often need more than one drug to achieve optimal glucose control. The aim of this study was to analyse the efficacy of two combination therapies on vascular function in subjects with T2DM., METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective, randomized study included 97 subjects with T2DM. Subjects were randomized to either the combination therapy empagliflozin (E) 10 mg with linagliptin (L) 5 mg once daily or metformin (M) 850 or 1000 mg twice daily with insulin glargine (I) once daily. At baseline and after 12 weeks, subjects had peripheral office and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurement and underwent vascular assessment by pulse wave analysis under office and ambulatory conditions. Office, 24-h ambulatory and central BP as well as pulse pressure (PP) decreased after 12 weeks of treatment with E + L, whereas no change was observed in M + I. There were greater decreases in 24-h ambulatory peripheral systolic (between-group difference: -5.2 +/- 1.5 mmHg, P = 0.004), diastolic BP (-1.9 +/- 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.036), and PP (-3.3 +/- 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.007) in E + L than M + I. Central office systolic BP (-5.56 +/- 1.9 mmHg, P = 0.009), forward pressure height of the pulse wave (-2.0 +/- 0.9 mmHg, P = 0.028), 24-h ambulatory central systolic (-3.6 +/- 1.4 mmHg, P = 0.045), diastolic BP (-1.95 +/- 1.1 mmHg, P = 0.041), and 24-h pulse wave velocity (-0.14 +/- 0.05m/s, P = 0.043) were reduced to a greater extent with E + L., CONCLUSION: Beyond the effects on glycaemic control, the combination therapy of E + L significantly improved central BP and vascular function compared with the classic combination of M + I., CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT02752113.

T1  - Review of Interventions for the Frailty Syndrome and the Role of Metformin as a Potential Pharmacologic Agent for Frailty Prevention.
N2  - PURPOSE: Frailty is a syndrome of vulnerability and physical decline with aging that increases risk for disability, hospitalizations, and death. To date, interventions for frailty have primarily focused on exercise and/or nutritional interventions, many of which show improvement in frailty-related characteristics, such as gait speed and lower extremity strength and function. The goal of this article was to review prior research studies investigating interventions for frailty and review the literature with regard to the role of insulin resistance and inflammation in the development of frailty. Also included is a discussion of potential therapeutic interventions for frailty., METHODS: A literature search was conducted by using PubMed and the search terms frailty, interventions, and older adults. This review focused on larger studies (N >= 100 participants) that examined the effect of specific interventions on frailty as a primary outcome or on measures that are closely related to frailty, such as gait speed, muscle strength, and/or sarcopenia., FINDINGS: The results of prior studies of exercise interventions for the frailty syndrome as the primary outcome are mixed, with some but not all showing benefit. However, many exercise interventions have demonstrated improvement in components of frailty, such as strength, gait speed, and physical activity. The evidence shows that regular physical activity is beneficial for frail older adults or those at high risk of frailty and that the adverse effects related to exercise are minimal compared with the potential gains. However, questions remain as to the optimal type and duration of exercise and whether results of clinical trials are easily and feasibly implemented in a clinical setting in individuals whose motivation for exercise may be low. There is now increasing interest in pharmacologic agents that could potentially be useful in the prevention or treatment of frailty, in part based on advances in basic biology of aging research demonstrating that pharmacological agents extend lifespan in rodents. Several studies now show that obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, and diabetes are associated with and predict frailty. Because metformin targets insulin resistance and inflammation, it is a plausible pharmacologic agent to prevent frailty. A clinical trial is underway to examine metformin's usefulness in frailty prevention., IMPLICATIONS: Although the benefits of exercise are known, adherence to these regimens may be difficult for individual older adults due to lack of motivation, access, or limitations due to chronic medical conditions. Studies are currently underway to examine novel agents for the prevention of frailty in older adults. Copyright Â© 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin vs. metformin monotherapy for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus therapy: a meta-analysis.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim is to assess the comparative efficacy and safety of combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin vs. metformin monotherapy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin vs. metformin monotherapy in patients with T2DM published up to 30 February 2021. The Cochrane tool and Revman 5.3 software was used to assess the risk of bias and conducted the meta-analysis in the included RCTs. Evidence level was assessed by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach., RESULTS: A total of 11 RCTs and 8533 patients were included. For the efficacy, we found that combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin (dose of metformin >=1500mg/d) had a significantly higher reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) [mean differences (MD)= -0.59, 95% CI (-0.28, -0.16), p<0.00001] and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level [MD= -0.82, 95% CI (-1.09, -0.56), p<0.00001] than combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin (dose of metformin <1500 mg/d). Vildagliptin plus metformin as combination therapy reduced body weight loss ratio [MD=0.22, 95% CI (0.17, 0.27), p<0.00001] when compared with metformin monotherapy. In terms of safety, the vildagliptin plus metformin as combination therapy did not increase risk of total adverse events (AEs) [RR=0.98, 95% CI (0.94,1.02), p=0.29], however there were significant statistical difference and did not increase the risk of diarrhea [RR=0.55, 95% CI (0.40, 0.76), p=0.0003] and Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders [RR=0.72, 95% CI (0.58, 0.91), p=0.006], but significantly increased risk of dizziness [RR=1.41, 95% CI (1.06, 1.88), p=0.02] when compared with metformin monotherapy., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with metformin, vildagliptin combined with metformin could significantly reduce FPG, HbA1c and body weight. When the dose of metformin in the combination group of vildagliptin and metformin is >=1500mg/d, the results showed significant reduction in HbA1c and FPG. In addition, it had no risk of increase in total AEs, diarrhea, and GI disorders, but had significant risk of increase in dizziness. GRADE showed that the quality of evidence had high certainty in FPG and moderate certainty in HbA1c, body weight and all AEs.

T1  - Liraglutide and Metformin alone or combined therapy for type 2 diabetes patients complicated with coronary artery disease.
N2  - BACKGROUND: This study is to compare the effects of Liraglutide and Metformin alone or combined treatment on the cardiac function in T2DM patients complicated with CAD., METHODS: 120 T2DM patients were included at Endocrinology Department of Tianjin First Center Hospital (Tianjin, China) from April 2012 to September 2013. The study contained two sections. Section 1: 30 patients in group 1 was treated with Liraglutide (Novo Nordisk) (1.2 mg/d), and 30 patients in group 2 with Metformin (Shiguibao) (1500 mg/d) for 24 weeks. Section 2: 30 patients in group1 was treated with Liraglutide (1.8 mg/d) and 30 in group 2 with Liraglutide (1.2 mg/d) plus Metformin (1500 mg/d) for 24 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial glucose (PPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), C reactive protein (CRP), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), ejection fraction (EF) and the ratio of early (E) to late (A) ventricular filling velocities (E/A ratio) were measured before and after the 24-week treatment., RESULTS: After 24-week treatment, when blood glucose level was controlled in 4 groups, Liraglutide alone treatment showed better improvements than on all measuring except TG in Section 1, however, combined treatment of Liraglutide and Metformin showed better improvements on all measuring except BMI, TG and BP in Section 2., CONCLUSIONS: With similar glycemic control, the Liraglutide (1.2 mg/d) monotherapy showed the better effects than either Metformin alone, or combination of Liraglutide and Metformin on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular function., TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( chictr.org.cn ) # ChiCTR-IPR-16008578 .

T1  - Efficacy and safety of the glucagon receptor antagonist PF-06291874: A 12-week, randomized, dose-response study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on background metformin therapy.
N2  - AIMS: To conduct a dose-response assessment of the efficacy and safety of the glucagon receptor antagonist PF-06291874 in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) using stable doses of metformin., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, statin-stratified, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, parallel-group study was conducted in patients with T2DM who were receiving background metformin. After an 8-week, non-metformin oral antidiabetic agent washout period, 206 patients were randomized to placebo or PF-06291874 (30, 60 or 100 mg once daily) for 12 weeks. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and safety endpoints were assessed at baseline and post baseline., RESULTS: Dose-dependent mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c for PF-06291874 ranged from -0.67% (-7.29 mmol/mol) to -0.93% (-10.13 mmol/mol), and for FPG from -16.6 to -33.3 mg/dL after 12 weeks of dosing. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low and was similar between groups receiving PF-06291874 and placebo. Small, non-dose-dependent increases in LDL cholesterol (<10%) and blood pressure (BP) (systolic BP > 2 mm Hg; diastolic BP > 1 mm Hg) were observed with PF-06291874. Modest non-dose-dependent median increases were observed across PF-06291874 groups at 12 weeks for alanine aminotransferase (range, 37.6-48.7 U/L vs placebo) and aspartate aminotransferase (range, 33.3-36.6 U/L vs placebo); these were not associated with bilirubin changes. Small increases were observed in body weight (< 0.5 kg) in each PF-06291874 group vs placebo., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM, PF-06291874 significantly lowered HbA1c and glucose, was well tolerated and carried a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Small, non-dose-related increases in BP, lipids and hepatic transaminases were observed. Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T1  - Efficacy of Once-Weekly Semaglutide vs Empagliflozin Added to Metformin in Type 2 Diabetes: Patient-Level Meta-analysis.
N2  - CONTEXT: No head-to-head trials have directly compared once-weekly (OW) semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, with empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, in type 2 diabetes (T2D)., OBJECTIVE: We indirectly compared the efficacy of OW semaglutide 1 mg vs once-daily (OD) empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy, using individual patient data (IPD) and meta-regression methodology., DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: IPD for patients with T2D receiving metformin monotherapy and randomized to OW semaglutide 1 mg (SUSTAIN 2, 3, 8 trials), or to OD empagliflozin 25 mg (PIONEER 2 trial) were included. Meta-regression analyses were adjusted for potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcomes were change from baseline to end-of-treatment (~1 year) in HbA1c (%-point) and body weight (kg). Responder outcomes and other clinically relevant efficacy measures were analyzed., RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between OW semaglutide (n = 995) and empagliflozin (n = 410). Our analyses showed that OW semaglutide significantly reduced mean HbA1c and body weight vs empagliflozin (estimated treatment difference: -0.61%-point [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.72; -0.49] and -1.65 kg [95% CI: -2.22; -1.08], respectively; both P < 0.0001). Complementary analyses supported the robustness of these results. A significantly greater proportion of patients on OW semaglutide vs empagliflozin also achieved HbA1c targets and weight-loss responses., CONCLUSIONS: This indirect comparison suggests that OW semaglutide 1 mg provides superior reductions in HbA1c and body weight vs OD empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D when added to metformin monotherapy.

T1  - Glycaemic control with add-on thiazolidinedione or a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes after the failure of an oral triple antidiabetic regimen: A 24-week, randomized controlled trial.
N2  - AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adding either a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) or thiazolidinedione (TZD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled with triple therapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, open-label, multicentre, 24-week clinical trial, we randomly assigned 119 patients with T2D who failed to achieve glycaemic control (7% < HbA1c <= 10%) with conventional triple oral antidiabetic agents (OADs; metformin, sulphonylurea and dipeptidyl peptide-4 [DPP-4] inhibitor) into two groups who received either an SGLT2i or TZD. The primary endpoint was mean change in HbA1c level between the two groups at 24 weeks., RESULTS: In total, 119 patients were enrolled in the SGLT2i (n = 60) and TZD (n = 59) groups. Mean age of the study subjects was 61.86 years, and the mean duration of T2D was 13.89 years. After 24 weeks, both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1c (from 7.94% +/- 0.74% to 6.97% +/- 0.84% in the SGLT2i group and from 8.00% +/- 0.78% to 7.18% +/- 0.98% in the TZD group), without a significant between-group difference (P = .235). A significant body mass index (BMI) reduction was noted in the SGLT2i group, whereas an increase in BMI was noted in the TZD group (-0.79 +/- 1.37 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.86 kg/m2 , P < .001). Other safety profiles were favourable in both groups., CONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that an SGLT2i or TZD could be a valid option as a fourth OAD for treatment of patients with T2D inadequately controlled with a triple combination of OADs.

T1  - Cardiorenal outcomes with dapagliflozin by baseline glucose-lowering agents: Post hoc analyses from DECLARE-TIMI 58.
N2  - AIM: To assess the associations between baseline glucose-lowering agents (GLAs) and cardiorenal outcomes with dapagliflozin versus placebo in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 study., MATERIALS AND METHODS: DECLARE-TIMI 58 assessed the cardiorenal outcomes of dapagliflozin versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes. This post hoc analysis elaborates the efficacy and safety outcomes by baseline GLA for treatment effect and GLA-based treatment interaction., RESULTS: At baseline, 14 068 patients (82.0%) used metformin, 7322 (42.7%) sulphonylureas, 2888 (16.8%) dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 750 (4.4%) glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and 7013 (40.9%) insulin. Dapagliflozin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death (CVD) and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) versus placebo regardless of baseline GLA, with greater benefit in the small group of patients with baseline use of GLP-1 RAs (HR [95% CI] 0.37 [0.18, 0.78] vs. 0.86 [0.75, 0.98] in GLP-1 RA users vs. non-users, Pinteraction = .03). The overall HR for major adverse cardiovascular events (CVD, myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke) was 0.93 (95% CI 0.84, 1.03) with dapagliflozin versus placebo, with no interaction by baseline GLA (Pinteraction > .05). The renal-specific outcome was reduced with dapagliflozin versus placebo in the overall cohort (HR [95%CI] 0.53[0.43-0.66]), with no interaction by baseline GLA (Pinteraction > .05). All of these outcomes were similar in those with versus those without baseline metformin use., CONCLUSIONS: The effects of dapagliflozin on cardiorenal outcomes were generally consistent regardless of baseline GLA, with consistent benefits regardless of baseline metformin use. The potential clinical benefit of combining sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors with GLP-1 RAs, given some evidence of cardiovascular risk reduction with both classes, should be explored further.

T1  - Development and Qualification of a Drug-Disease Modeling Platform to Characterize Clinically Relevant Endpoints in Type 2 Diabetes Trials.
N2  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by persistently elevated blood glucose concentration (hyperglycemia). We developed a mechanistic drug-disease modeling platform based on data from more than 4,000 T2DM subjects in seven phase II/III clinical trials. The model integrates longitudinal changes in clinically relevant biomarkers of glycemic control with information on baseline disease state, demographics, disease progression, and different therapeutic interventions, either when given alone or as add-on combination therapy. The model was able to simultaneously characterize changes in fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, and glycated hemoglobin A1c following administration of sulfonylurea, metformin, and thiazolidinedione as well as disease progression in clinical trials ranging from 16-104 weeks of treatment. The mechanistic components of this generalized mechanism-based platform, based on knowledge of pharmacology, insulin-glucose homeostatic feedback, and diabetes pathophysiology, allows its application to be further expanded to other antidiabetic drug classes and combination therapies.

T1  - Metformin and blood cancers.
N2  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer are correlated with changes in insulin signaling, a pathway that is frequently upregulated in neoplastic tissue but impaired in tissues that are classically targeted by insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Many antidiabetes treatments, particularly metformin, enhance insulin signaling, but this pathway can be inhibited by specific cancer treatments. The modulation of cancer growth by metformin and of insulin sensitivity by anticancer drugs is so common that this phenomenon is being studied in hundreds of clinical trials on cancer. Many meta-analyses have consistently shown a moderate but direct effect of body mass index on the incidence of multiple myeloma and lymphoma and the elevated risk of leukemia in adults. Moreover, new epidemiological and preclinical studies indicate metformin as a therapeutic agent in patients with leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. In this article, we review current findings on the anticancer activities of metformin and the underlying mechanisms from preclinical and ongoing studies in hematologic malignancies.

T1  - TriMaster: randomised double-blind crossover study of a DPP4 inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor and thiazolidinedione as second-line or third-line therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who have suboptimal glycaemic control on metformin treatment with or without a sulfonylurea-a MASTERMIND study protocol.
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Pharmaceutical treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have increased to include multiple classes of oral glucose-lowering agents but without accompanying guidance on which of these may most benefit individual patients. Clinicians lack information for treatment intensification after first-line metformin therapy. Stratifying patients by simple clinical characteristics may improve care by targeting treatment options to those in whom they are most effective. This academically designed and run three-way crossover trial aims to test a stratification approach using three standard oral glucose-lowering agents., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: TriMaster is a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial taking place at up to 25 clinical sites across England, Scotland and Wales. 520 patients with T2DM treated with either metformin alone, or metformin and a sulfonylurea who have glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) >58 mmol/mol will be randomised to receive 16 weeks each of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor and thiazolidinedione in random order. Participants will be assessed at the end of each treatment period, providing clinical and biochemical data, and their experience of side effects. Participant preference will be assessed on completion of all three treatments. The primary endpoint is HbA1c after 4 months of therapy (allowing a range of 12-18 weeks for analysis). Secondary endpoints include participant-reported preference between the three treatments, tolerability and prevalence of side effects., ETHICAL APPROVAL: This study was approved by National Health Service Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee South Central-Oxford A, study 16/SC/0147. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant scientific meetings. A lay summary of results will be made available to all participants., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: 12039221; 2015-002790-38 and NCT02653209. Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

T1  - Lower nocturnal blood glucose response to a potato-based mixed evening meal compared to rice in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
N2  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Guidelines for reducing postprandial blood glucose concentrations include avoiding high glycemic index (GI) foods, such as white potatoes. However, GI testing is often undertaken in the morning with foods consumed in isolation by non-clinical cohorts. We investigated the impact of potato preparation and consumption as part of a mixed-evening meal on postprandial and nocturnal glycemic responses, and postprandial insulin response, in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)., METHODS: In a randomized, cross-over design, 24 males and females (age 58.3 +/- 9.3 y; BMI: 31.7 +/- 6.8 kg/m2) with T2DM (diet or metformin controlled) completed four experimental trials after consuming a standardized breakfast (25% daily energy intake (EI)) and lunch (35% EI). Dinner (40% EI) was consumed at 1800 h being either: 1) boiled potato (BOIL); 2) roasted potato (ROAST); 3) boiled potato cooled for 24 h (COOLED); or 4) basmati rice (CONTROL). Each meal contained 50% carbohydrate, 30% fat and 20% protein. Blood samples were collected prior to, immediately post meal and at 30-min intervals for a further 120 min. A continuous glucose monitor was worn to assess nocturnal interstitial glucose concentrations., RESULTS: No differences were detected in postprandial venous glucose area under the curve (iAUC) between CONTROL and all three potato conditions. Postprandial insulin iAUC was greater following COOLED compared to CONTROL (P = 0.003; 95% CI: 18.9-111.72 miU/mL). No significant differences between CONTROL and BOIL or ROAST were detected for postprandial insulin concentrations. All potato meals resulted in lower nocturnal glucose AUC than CONTROL (P < 0.001; 95% CI 4.15-15.67 mmol/L x h)., CONCLUSION: Compared to an isoenergetic rice meal, boiled, roasted or boiled then cooled potato-based meals were not associated with unfavourable postprandial glucose responses or nocturnal glycemic control, and can be considered suitable for individuals with T2DM when consumed as part of a mixed-evening meal., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry https://www.anzctr.org.au/, ACTRN 12618000480280.

T1  - Cardiovascular safety and efficacy of metformin-SGLT2i versus metformin-sulfonylureas in type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
N2  - Diabetes is a serious threat to global health and among the top 10 causes of death, with nearly half a billion people living with it worldwide. Treating patients with diabetes tend to become more challenging due to the progressive nature of the disease. The role and benefits of combination therapies for the management of type 2 diabetes are well-documented, while the comparative safety and efficacy among the different combination options have not been elucidated. We aimed to systematically synthesize the evidence on the comparative cardiovascular safety and efficacy of combination therapy with metformin-sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus metformin-sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes. We searched MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 15 August 2019 without restriction in the year of publication. We included randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes who were on metformin-sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors or metformin-sulphonylureas combination therapy at least for a year. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events, and the secondary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hypoglycemia, and changes in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body weight, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We used a random-effects meta-analysis model to estimate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes. We followed PICOS description model for defining eligibility and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 guidelines for reporting results. Of 3,190 citations, we included nine trials involving 10,974 participants. The pooled analysis showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality (risk ration [RR] = 0.93, 95% CI [0.52, 1.67]), serious adverse events (RR = 0.96, 95% CI [0.79, 1.17]) and adverse events (RR = 1.00, 95% CI [0.99, 1.02]) between the two, but in hypoglycemia (RR = 0.13, 95% CI [0.10, 0.17], P < 0.001). Participants taking metformin-sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors showed a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c (mean difference [MD] = - 0.10%, 95% CI [- 0.17, - 0.03], body weight (MD = - 4.57 kg, 95% CI [- 4.74, - 4.39], systolic blood pressure (MD = - 4.77 mmHg, 95% CI [- 5.39, - 4.16]), diastolic blood pressure (MD = - 2.07 mmHg, 95% CI [- 2.74, - 1.40], and fasting plasma glucose (MD = - 0.55 mmol/L, 95% CI [- 0.69, - 0.41]), p < 0.001. Combination therapy of metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors is a safe and efficacious alternative to combination therapy of metformin and sulphonylureas for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at risk of cardiovascular comorbidity. However, there remains a need for additional long-term randomized controlled trials as available studies are very limited and heterogeneous.

T1  - The effect of empagliflozin on growth differentiation factor 15 in patients with heart failure: a randomized controlled trial (Empire HF Biomarker).
N2  - BACKGROUND: Plasma growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) biomarker levels increase in response to inflammation and tissue injury, and increased levels of GDF-15 are associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which improve outcome in HFrEF, have been shown to increase plasma GDF-15 in diabetic patients. We aimed to investigate the effect of empagliflozin on GDF-15 in HFrEF patients., METHODS: This Empire HF Biomarker substudy was from the multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Empire HF trial that included 190 patients from June 29, 2017, to September 10, 2019. Stable ambulatory HFrEF patients with ejection fraction of <= 40% were randomly assigned (1:1) to empagliflozin 10 mg once daily, or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Changes from baseline to 12 weeks in plasma levels of GDF-15, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and high-sensitive troponin T (hsTNT) were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 187 patients who were included in this study, mean age was 64 +/- 11 years; 85% male, 12% with type 2 diabetes, mean ejection fraction 29 +/- 8, with no differences between the groups. Baseline median plasma GDF-15 was 1189 (918-1720) pg/mL with empagliflozin, and 1299 (952-1823) pg/mL for placebo. Empagliflozin increased plasma GDF-15 compared to placebo (adjusted between-groups treatment effect; ratio of change (1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.15]: p = 0.0040). The increase in plasma GDF15 was inversely associated with a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic (R = - 0.23, p = 0.031), and end-diastolic volume (R = - 0.29, p = 0.0066). There was no change in plasma hsCRP (1.09 [95%CI, 0.86-1.38]: p = 0.48) or plasma hsTNT (1.07 [95%CI, 0.97-1.19]: p = 0.18) compared to placebo. Patients with diabetes and treated with metformin demonstrated no increase in plasma GDF-15 with empagliflozin, p for interaction = 0.01., CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin increased plasma levels of GDF-15 in patients with HFrEF, with no concomitant increase in hsTNT nor hsCRP., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Empire HF trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03198585.

T1  - Metformin Biodistribution: A Key to Mechanisms of Action?.
N2  - Metformin has undisputed glucose-lowering effects in diabetes and an impressive safety record. It has also shown promising effects beyond diabetes, and several hundred clinical trials involving metformin are currently planned or active. Metformin targets intracellular effectors, but exactly which remain to be established, and in an era of precision medicine, an incomplete understanding of mechanisms of action may limit the use of metformin. Distribution of metformin depends on specific organic cation transporter proteins that are organ- and species-specific. Therefore, target tissues of metformin can be identified by cellular uptake of the drug, and exploring the biodistribution of the drug in humans becomes an attractive strategy to assist the many investigations into the mechanisms of action of metformin performed in animals. In this review, we combine the emerging evidence from the use of 11C-labeled metformin in humans to discuss metformin action in liver, intestines, and kidney, which are the organs with the most avid uptake of the drug.

T1  - Metabolomic Approaches to Investigate the Effect of Metformin: An Overview.
N2  - Metformin is the first-line antidiabetic drug that is widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Even though the various therapeutic potential of metformin treatment has been reported, as well as the improvement of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, the mechanisms underlying those benefits are still not fully understood. In order to explain the beneficial effects on metformin treatment, various metabolomics analyses have been applied to investigate the metabolic alterations in response to metformin treatment, and significant systemic metabolome changes were observed in biofluid, tissues, and cells. In this review, we compare the latest metabolomic research including clinical trials, animal models, and in vitro studies comprehensively to understand the overall changes of metabolome on metformin treatment.

T1  - Exploring residual risk for diabetes and microvascular disease in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS).
N2  - AIM: Approximately half of the participants in the Diabetes Prevention Outcomes Study (DPPOS) had diabetes after 15 years of follow-up, whereas nearly all the others remained with pre-diabetes. We examined whether formerly unexplored factors in the DPPOS coexisted with known risk factors that posed additional risk for, or protection from, diabetes as well as microvascular disease., METHODS: Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine predictors of diabetes. Sequential modelling procedures considered known and formerly unexplored factors. We also constructed models to determine whether the same unexplored factors that associated with progression to diabetes also predicted the prevalence of microvascular disease. Hazard ratios (HR) are per standard deviation change in the variable., RESULTS: In models adjusted for demographics and known diabetes risk factors, two formerly unknown factors were associated with risk for both diabetes and microvascular disease: number of medications taken (HR = 1.07, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 1.03 to 1.12 for diabetes; odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.16 for microvascular disease) and variability in HbA1c (HR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03 for diabetes; OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.09 for microvascular disease per sd). Total comorbidities increased risk for diabetes (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.16), whereas higher systolic (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.31) and diastolic (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22) blood pressure, as well as the use of anti-hypertensives (OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.62), increased risk of microvascular disease., CONCLUSIONS: Several formerly unexplored factors in the DPPOS predicted additional risk for diabetes and/or microvascular disease - particularly hypertension and the use of anti-hypertensive medications - helping to explain some of the residual disease risk in participants of the DPPOS.

T1  - Effects of linagliptin on endothelial function and postprandial lipids in coronary artery disease patients with early diabetes: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Early glucose lowering intervention in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus was demonstrated to be beneficial in terms of micro- and macrovascular risk reduction. However, most of currently ongoing cardiovascular outcome trials are performed in subjects with manifest atherosclerosis and long-standing diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD) but early type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on a set of cardiovascular surrogate measurements., METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center study, we included subjects with early diabetes (postchallenge diabetes (2 h glucose > 200 mg/dl) or T2DM treated with diet only or on a stable dose of metformin monotherapy and an HbA1c < 75 mmol/mol) and established CAD. Participants were randomized to receive either linagliptin (5 mg) once daily orally or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in flow mediated dilatation (FMD). The secondary objective was to investigate the effect of linagliptin treatment on arginine bioavailability ratios [Global arginine bioavailability ratio (GABR) and arginine to ornithine ratio (AOR)]. Arginine, ornithine and citrulline were measured in serum samples with a conventional usual amino acid analysis technique, involving separation of amino acids by ion exchange chromatography followed by postcolumn continuous reaction with ninhydrin. GABR was calculated by L-arginine divided by the sum of (L-ornithine plus L-citrulline). The AOR was calculated by dividing L-arginine by L-ornithine levels. Group comparisons were calculated by using a two-sample t-test with Satterthwaite adjustment for unequal variances., RESULTS: We investigated 43 patients (21% female) with a mean age of 63.3 +/- 8.2 years. FMD at baseline was 3.5 +/- 3.1% in the linagliptin group vs. 4.0 +/- 2.9% in the placebo group. The change in mean FMD in the linagliptin group was not significantly different compared to the change in the placebo group (0.43 +/- 4.84% vs. - 0.45 +/- 3.01%; p = 0.486). No significant improvements were seen in the arginine bioavailability ratios (GABR; p = 0.608 and AOR; p = 0.549)., CONCLUSION: Linagliptin treatment in subjects with CAD and early T2DM did not improve endothelial function or the arginine bioavailability ratios.

T1  - An Efficacy and Safety Study of Remogliflozin in Obese Indian Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients Who Were Inadequately Controlled on Insulin Glargine Plus other Oral Hypoglycemic Agents.
N2  - AIMS & OBJECTIVES: The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the efficacy of adding remogliflozin to current insulin glargine plus two oral drug i.e. metformin and teneligliptin therapy in poorly controlled Indian type 2 diabetes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: 173 study participants were initially selected from patient database who continued on their insulin glargine or received an increased dose of insulin glargine along with other OHA based therapy (Group A) and 187 were selected who had received remogliflozin (100 mg BD) (Group B) in addition to insulin glargine along with other OHA based therapy. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), total daily insulin dose, body weight, and the number of hypoglycemic events were recorded at weeks 0, 12 and 24., RESULTS: During the study, mean values of HbA1c, FBG and P2BG were significantly reduced in both groups. Insulin requirements decreased from 45.8 +/- 16.7 IU/day to 38.5 +/- 13.5 IU/day at week 12 (P < 0.001) and at week 24 even further decreased to 29.5 +/- 14.5 IU/Day. Twenty three patients in group B were able to cease insulin treatment altogether after 24 week treatment. It has been observed that to attain tight blood glucose control, we need to increase insulin dose in group A from 45.5 +/- 16.5 IU/Day to 51.5 +/- 14.5 at week 12 (P<0.01), which further increased to 53.8 +/- 12.8 IU/Day at week 24 (P<0.01). Adding remogliflozin showed significant effect on blood pressure (P < 0.001) and weight reduction (P < 0.001). It has been observed that 38% patients achieved targeted HbA1c (<=7%) in group B where it was 22% in group A., CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that in uncontrolled T2DM patients, remogliflozin 100 mg BD can successfully lay a foundation for prolonged good glycemic control. Early addition of remogliflozin with insulin glargine plus OHAs may be an alternative compared to intensive up titration of insulin daily dose in people with uncontrolled T2DM.

T1  - Effects of Long-term Metformin and Lifestyle Interventions on Cardiovascular Events in the Diabetes Prevention Program and Its Outcome Study.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle intervention and metformin have been shown to prevent diabetes; however, their efficacy in preventing cardiovascular disease associated with the development of diabetes is unclear. We examined whether these interventions reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events over a 21-year median follow-up of participants in the DPP trial (Diabetes Prevention Program) and DPPOS (Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study)., METHODS: During DPP, 3234 participants with impaired glucose tolerance were randomly assigned to metformin 850 mg twice daily, intensive lifestyle or placebo, and followed for 3 years. During the next 18-year average follow-up in DPPOS, all participants were offered a less intensive group lifestyle intervention, and unmasked metformin was continued in the metformin group. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death adjudicated by standard criteria. An extended cardiovascular outcome included the primary outcome or hospitalization for heart failure or unstable angina, coronary or peripheral revascularization, coronary heart disease diagnosed by angiography, or silent myocardial infarction by ECG. ECGs and cardiovascular risk factors were measured annually., RESULTS: Neither metformin nor lifestyle intervention reduced the primary outcome: metformin versus placebo hazard ratio 1.03 (95% CI, 0.78-1.37; P = 0.81) and lifestyle versus placebo hazard ratio 1.14 (95% CI, 0.87-1.50; P = 0.34). Risk factor adjustment did not change these results. No effect of either intervention was seen on the extended cardiovascular outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Neither metformin nor lifestyle reduced major cardiovascular events in DPPOS over 21 years despite long-term prevention of diabetes. Provision of group lifestyle intervention to all, extensive out-of-study use of statin and antihypertensive agents, and reduction in the use of study metformin together with out-of-study metformin use over time may have diluted the effects of the interventions., REGISTRATION: URL: https://www., CLINICALTRIALS: gov; Unique identifiers: DPP (NCT00004992) and DPPOS (NCT00038727).

T1  - Effect of Dapagliflozin on Glycemic Control, Weight, and Blood Pressure in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Attending a Specialist Endocrinology Practice in Canada: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis.
N2  - BACKGROUND: In randomized clinical trials, dapagliflozin has been shown to improve glycemic control, weight, and blood pressure. However, there is little real-world evidence of the effectiveness of dapagliflozin. The objective of this study is to investigate the real-world treatment outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who initiated dapagliflozin in a referral-based endocrinology practice., METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with T2D who initiated dapagliflozin in 2015, using data from a large, specialist diabetes registry in Canada., RESULTS: 1520 patients were eligible for analysis. Following 3 to 6 months of treatment, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) decreased by a mean of 0.9% +/- 1.3% (9.8 +/- 14.2 mmol/mol) (P < 0.01), weight decreased 2.2 +/- 3.1 kg (P < 0.01), and systolic blood pressure decreased 3.7 +/- 14.3 mmHg (P < 0.01). The proportion of patients who achieved glycemic control (HbA1c <=7.0%) increased from 7.0% at baseline to 27.0% during follow-up. There was also a statistically significant decrease from baseline in body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, and the proportion of patients with microalbuminuria (P < 0.01). A higher baseline HbA1c, shorter duration of diabetes, male gender, and greater weight loss were each independently associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c (P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world clinical setting in Canada, dapagliflozin produced significant improvements in HbA1c, weight, and blood pressure in patients with T2D, comparable to that seen in randomized clinical trials.

T1  - Metformin and daclatasvir: absence of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic drug interaction in healthy volunteers.
N2  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the proposed organic cation transporter (OCT) inhibitor daclatasvir on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the OCT substrate metformin., METHODS: This was an open-label, two-period, randomized, crossover trial in 20 healthy subjects. Treatment A consisted of metformin and treatment B consisted of metformin + daclatasvir. Pharmacokinetic curves were recorded at steady-state. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for metformin area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to 12 h (AUC0-12 ), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) and final plasma concentration (Clast ). An oral glucose tolerance test was performed, measuring insulin, glucose and lactate levels., RESULTS: The GMRs (90% CI) of metformin AUC0-12 , Cmax and Clast (B vs. A) were 109% (102-116%), 108% (101-116%) and 112% (103-122%). The geometric mean AUC0-2 for insulin, glucose and lactate during treatments A and B were 84 h. mEl-1 and 90 h. mEl-1 , 13.6 h. mmol l-1 and 13.4 h. mmol l-1 , and 3.4 h. mmol l-1 and 3.5 h. mmol l-1 , respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Bioequivalence analysis showed that daclatasvir does not influence the pharmacokinetics of metformin in healthy subjects. Pharmacodynamic parameters were also comparable between treatments. Copyright Â© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.

T1  - Effect of Metformin vs. Placebo in Combination with Insulin Analogues on Bone Markers P1NP and CTX in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
N2  - Preclinical studies have shown a potential osteoanabolic effect of metformin but human studies of how metformin affects bone turnover are few. A post hoc sub-study analysis of an 18-month multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), randomizing participants to metformin versus placebo both in combination with different insulin analogue regimens (Metformin + Insulin vs. Placebo + Insulin). Patients were not treatment naive at baseline, 83% had received metformin, 69% had received insulin, 57.5% had received the combination of metformin and insulin before entering the study. Bone formation and resorption were assessed by measuring, N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) at baseline and end of study. The influence of gender, age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), T2DM duration, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), c-reactive protein (CRP) and insulin dosage was also included in the analyses. The levels of bone formation marker P1NP and bone resorption marker CTX increased significantly in both groups during the trial. P1NP increased less in the Metformin + Insulin compared to the placebo + insulin group (p = 0.001) (between group difference change), while the increases in CTX levels (p = 0.11) were not different. CRP was inversely associated (p = 0.012) and insulin dosage (p = 0.011) was positively related with change in P1NP levels. BMI (p = 0.002) and HbA1C (p = 0.037) were inversely associated with change in CTX levels. During 18 months of treatment with metformin or placebo, both in combination with insulin, bone turnover increased in both groups. But the pattern was different as the bone formation marker (P1NP) increased less during Metformin + Insulin treatment, while change in bone resorption (CTX) was not significantly different between the two groups.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of anti-hyperglycaemic drugs in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with or without diabetes: An updated systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
N2  - AIM: There are no approved drugs for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, many randomized controlled trials (RCT) have examined the effect of anti-hyperglycaemic agents on NAFLD in patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), since both T2DM and insulin resistance are closely linked to this burdensome liver disease., METHODS: We systematically searched publication databases using predefined keywords to identify head-to-head or placebo-controlled RCTs (published until September 30, 2019) of NAFLD individuals testing the efficacy of anti-hyperglycaemic drugs to specifically treat NAFLD or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Outcomes of interest included changes in serum liver enzyme levels, liver fat, liver fibrosis, or histologic resolution of NASH., RESULTS: We included 29 RCTs involving a total of 2,617 individuals (~45% had T2DM) that have used metformin (n=6 studies), glitazones (n=8 studies), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (n=6 studies), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (n=4 studies) or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (n=7 studies) to treat NAFLD. Although most anti-hyperglycaemic drugs improved serum liver enzyme levels, only glitazones (especially pioglitazone) and liraglutide showed an improvement of histologic features of NAFLD, with a mild beneficial effect also on liver fibrosis for pioglitazone only., CONCLUSION: RCT evidence supports the efficacy of some anti-hyperglycaemic agents (especially pioglitazone) in patients with NAFLD or NASH, though weight gain with pioglitazone may warrant caution. Further well-designed RCTs are needed to better characterize the efficacy and safety of monotherapy and combination therapy with anti-hyperglycaemic agents in patients with NAFLD.

T1  - Effect of a New Formulation of Nutraceuticals as an Add-On to Metformin Monotherapy for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Suboptimal Glycemic Control: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
N2  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the overall biohumoral and metabolic effects of a 12-week add-on therapy consisting of a new nutraceutical formulation (BHC) based on berberine, hesperidin, and chromium picolinate in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) patients with suboptimal glycemic compensation receiving metformin. After 12 weeks, participants in the group receiving metformin plus BHC, compared to the group receiving metformin only, saw a significant improvement in their glucose profile, in terms of both glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Their FBG dropped from 145 +/- 20 mg/dL to 128 +/- 23 mg/dL (p < 0.01), a decrease of 11.7% compared with the baseline. This decrease differed significantly from the situation in the control arm (p < 0.05). HbA1c decreased by 7.5% from the baseline, from 53.5 +/- 4.3 mmol/mol to 49.5 +/- 5.1 mmol/mol (p < 0.01), in the group given BHC, while no difference was seen in the control group. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were found to be significantly reduced (p < 0.01) only in the BHC group, from 9.34 +/- 7.61 mug/mL to 6.75 +/- 6.13 mug/mL, and from 1.7 +/- 0.15 mumol/L to 1.4 +/- 0.25 mumol/L, respectively. In patients with T2D taking metformin with suboptimal glycemic compensation, adding BHC for 3 months significantly improved glucose control in terms of FBG and HbA1c, and had a positive effect on the lipid peroxidation profile, as indicated by a decrease in AGEs and MDA.

T1  - Tracking the Sugar Rush: Incorporating Continuous Glucose Monitoring Into Multisite Early Clinical Research With Type 2 Diabetes Subjects.
N2  - Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems allow patients with diabetes mellitus to closely track glucose concentrations over several days, identify trends in glucose levels, and avoid glucose excursions. This technology has not only advanced diabetes mellitus management but has increased patient safety through greater glycemic awareness. Due to these attributes, CGM is now being applied in therapeutic research as a pharmacodynamic tool to support early clinical drug development programs. However, to date only a handful of studies have utilized CGM in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) drug development. A potential barrier from fostering greater use of CGM in clinical development may be related to concerns over subject variability. Therefore, we investigated a key consideration when implementing CGM into early clinical research studies: daily variation within patients with T2DM from multiple clinical research units. From 24 patients with T2DM, we observed strong daily reproducibility (Pearson R = 0.86, P < .0001) in CGM results and found that this technique is practical for multisite studies. Altogether, with low daily variability, CGM is a powerful pharmacodynamic tool for drug efficacy and safety monitoring. Copyright Â© 2018, The Authors.

T1  - Reduction in HbA1c with SGLT2 inhibitors vs. DPP-4 inhibitors as add-ons to metformin monotherapy according to baseline HbA1c: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
N2  - AIMS: This study compared the reduction of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) with sodium-glucose cotransporter type-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) vs. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) as add-ons to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with a specific focus on HbA1c changes according to baseline HbA1c., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic databases were scrutinized for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the reduction of HbA1c from baseline (DELTA HbA1c) with an SGLT2i or DPP-4i in patients with T2DM not well controlled by metformin monotherapy. The endpoint was DELTA HbA1c using both indirect and direct comparisons., RESULTS: Overall, DELTA HbA1c was slightly greater with SGLT2is (-0.80+/-0.20% from 8.03+/-0.35%; 44 analyses, 29 RCTs, 15 with two doses, n=9321) than with DPP-4is (-0.71+/-0.23% from 8.05+/-0.43%; 61 analyses, 59 RCTs, n=17,914; P=0.0354). When the mean baseline HbA1c was<8% ([64mmol/mol] 7.79+/-0.15% vs. 7.71+/-0.23%), DELTA HbA1c averaged -0.735+/-0.17% vs. -0.62+/-0.16% (P=0.0117) with SGLT2is vs. DPP-4is, respectively. However, this difference vanished when the mean baseline HbA1c was>=8% (-0.87+/-0.22% from 8.27+/-0.32% with SGLT2is vs. -0.80+/-0.24% from 8.35+/-0.33% with DPP-4is; P=0.2756). The relationship between DELTA HbA1c and baseline HbA1c was only slightly stronger with SGLT2is (slope: -0.39, r2=-0.43; P<0.0001) than with DPP-4is (slope: -0.26, r2=-0.25; P<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Because of the small difference in DELTA HbA1c whatever the baseline HbA1c level with SGLT2is vs. DPP-4is as add-ons to metformin, choosing between these glucose-lowering agents in clinical practice should be based on other efficacy criteria (such as weight and blood pressure changes, cardiovascular and renal protection) or on safety profiles rather than on HbA1c levels.

T1  - Effects of Sodium-glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor Monotherapy on Weight Changes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: a Bayesian Network Meta-analysis.
N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor monotherapy on the weight of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to compare different SGLT2 inhibitors with other oral glucose-lowering medications., METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and the ClinicalTrials.gov Web site were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials. Patients with T2DM in the included studies were administered SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy for at least 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in weight from baseline; the secondary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving a weight reduction >=5%. A pairwise meta-analysis using the DerSimonian-Laird random effects model and a network meta-analysis with Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo random effects models were performed., FINDINGS: A total of 29 randomized controlled trials (11,999 patients) with a low risk of bias were identified. The results showed that the mean weight loss ranged from -2.26 kg (95% credible interval [CrI], -2.71 to -1.76) with canagliflozin 300 mg to -0.79 kg (95% CrI, -1.54 to -0.05) with ipragliflozin 25 mg compared with metformin. Compared with linagliptin and sitagliptin, the mean weight loss ranged from -3.17 kg (95% CrI, -3.67 to -2.57) with canagliflozin 300 mg to -0.93 kg (95% CrI, -1.92 to 0.05) with ipragliflozin 25 mg. Canagliflozin 300 mg reduced weight to a greater extent than the other SGLT2 inhibitors, with a probability of 99.44%. SGLT2 inhibitors also improved the proportions of patients achieving >=5% weight loss. The effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on weight reduction was associated with dosage., IMPLICATIONS: Available evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy exerts more beneficial effects on weight reduction than both metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors. The weight reduction effect of 300 mg canagliflozin is greater than that of most other SGLT2 inhibitors. More types of SGLT2 inhibitors in a head-to-head trial, as well as a comparison between SGLT2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, will be involved in our further research.

N2  - Importance: Type 2 diabetes is common and is a leading cause of morbidity and disability., Objective: To review the evidence on screening for prediabetes and diabetes to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)., Data Sources: PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through September 2019; references; and experts; literature surveillance through May 21, 2021., Study Selection: English-language controlled studies evaluating screening or interventions for prediabetes or diabetes that was screen detected or recently diagnosed., Data Extraction and Synthesis: Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings; meta-analyses conducted when at least 3 similar studies were available., Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes-related morbidity, development of diabetes, quality of life, and harms., Results: The review included 89 publications (N = 68882). Two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (25120 participants) found no significant difference between screening and control groups for all-cause or cause-specific mortality at 10 years. For harms (eg, anxiety or worry), the trials reported no significant differences between screening and control groups. For recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, 5 RCTs (5138 participants) were included. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, health outcomes were improved with intensive glucose control with sulfonylureas or insulin. For example, for all-cause mortality the relative risk (RR) was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96) over 20 years (10-year posttrial assessment). For overweight persons, intensive glucose control with metformin improved health outcomes at the 10-year follow-up (eg, all-cause mortality: RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.91]), and benefits were maintained longer term. Lifestyle interventions (most involving >360 minutes) for obese or overweight persons with prediabetes were associated with reductions in the incidence of diabetes (23 RCTs; pooled RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.88]). Lifestyle interventions were also associated with improved intermediate outcomes, such as reduced weight, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure (pooled weighted mean difference, -1.7 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.6 to -0.8] and -1.2 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4], respectively). Metformin was associated with a significant reduction in diabetes incidence (pooled RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.83]) and reduction in weight and body mass index., Conclusions and Relevance: Trials of screening for diabetes found no significant mortality benefit but had insufficient data to assess other health outcomes; evidence on harms of screening was limited. For persons with recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, interventions improved health outcomes; for obese or overweight persons with prediabetes, interventions were associated with reduced incidence of diabetes and improvement in other intermediate outcomes.

T1  - Exendin-4 from Heloderma suspectum venom: From discovery to its latest application as type II diabetes combatant.
N2  - Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic non-communicable disease due to abnormal insulin actions causing uncontrolled hyperglycaemia. The treatment for T2DM, for instance, metformin and incretin mimetic, mainly focuses on the restoration of insulin sensitivity and secretion. Exendin-4 is a short incretin-mimetic peptide consisting of 39 amino acids. It is discovered in the venom of Heloderma suspectum as a full agonist for the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor and produces insulinotropic effects. It is more resistant to enzymatic degradation by dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 and has a longer half-life than the endogenous GLP-1; thus, it is further developed as an incretin hormone analogue used to treat T2DM. The helical region of the peptide first interacts with the extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) of GLP-1 receptor while the C-terminal extension containing the tryptophan cage further enhances its binding affinity. After binding to the NTD of the receptor, it may cause the receptor to switch from its auto-inhibited state of the receptor to its auto-activated state. Exendin-4 enhances the physiological functions of beta-cells and the up-regulation of GLP-1 receptors, thus reducing the plasma glucose levels. Moreover, exendin-4 has also been found to ameliorate neuropathy, nephropathy and ventricular remodelling. The therapeutic effects of exendin-4 have also been extrapolated into several clinical trials. Although exendin-4 has a reasonable subcutaneous bioavailability, its half-life is rather short. Therefore, several modifications have been undertaken to improve its pharmacokinetics and insulinotropic potency. This review focuses on the pharmacology of exendin-4 and the structure-function relationships of exendin-4 with GLP-1 receptor. The review also highlights some challenges and future directions in the improvement of exendin-4 as an anti-diabetic drug.

T1  - Metformin-induced glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion contributes to the actions of metformin in type 2 diabetes.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Metformin reduces plasma glucose and has been shown to increase glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion. Whether this is a direct action of metformin on GLP-1 release, and whether some of the glucose-lowering effect of metformin occurs due to GLP-1 release, is unknown. The current study investigated metformin-induced GLP-1 secretion and its contribution to the overall glucose-lowering effect of metformin and underlying mechanisms in patients with type 2 diabetes., METHODS: Twelve patients with type 2 diabetes were included in this placebo-controlled, double-blinded study. On 4 separate days, the patients received metformin (1,500 mg) or placebo suspended in a liquid meal, with subsequent i.v. infusion of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin9-39 (Ex9-39) or saline. During 240 minutes, blood was sampled. The direct effect of metformin on GLP-1 secretion was tested ex vivo in human ileal and colonic tissue with and without dorsomorphin-induced inhibiting of the AMPK activity., RESULTS: Metformin increased postprandial GLP-1 secretion compared with placebo (P = 0.014), and the postprandial glucose excursions were significantly smaller after metformin + saline compared with metformin + Ex9-39 (P = 0.004). Ex vivo metformin acutely increased GLP-1 secretion (colonic tissue, P < 0.01; ileal tissue, P < 0.05), but the effect was abolished by inhibition of AMPK activity., CONCLUSIONS: Metformin has a direct and AMPK-dependent effect on GLP-1-secreting L cells and increases postprandial GLP-1 secretion, which seems to contribute to metformin's glucose-lowering effect and mode of action., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02050074 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02050074)., FUNDING: This study received grants from the A.P. Moller Foundation, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Danish Medical Association research grant, the Australian Research Council, the National Health and Medical Research Council, and Pfizer Inc.

T1  - Intermittent fasting in Type 2 diabetes mellitus and the risk of hypoglycaemia: a randomized controlled trial.
N2  - AIMS: To establish whether the risk of hypoglycaemia is greater with 2 consecutive days of very-low-calorie diet compared with 2 non-consecutive days of very-low-calorie diet in people with Type 2 diabetes., METHODS: This was a non-blinded randomized parallel group interventional trial of intermittent fasting in adults. The participants had a BMI of 30-45 kg/m2 , Type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and/or hypoglycaemic medications and an HbA1c concentration of 50-86 mmol/mol (6.7-10%). The participants followed a 2092-2510-kJ diet on 2 days per week for 12 weeks. A total of 41 participants were randomized 1:1 to consecutive (n=19) or non-consecutive (n=22) day fasts, of whom 37 (n=18 and n=19, respectively) were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was difference in the rate of hypoglycaemia between the two study arms. Secondary outcomes included change in diet, quality of life, weight, lipid, glucose and HbA1c levels, and liver function., RESULTS: The mean hypoglycaemia rate was 1.4 events over 12 weeks. Fasting increased the rate of hypoglycaemia despite medication reduction (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.52). There was no difference between fasting on consecutive days and fasting on non-consecutive days (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.35 to 6.11). Improvements in weight, HbA1c , fasting glucose and quality of life were experienced by participants in both arms., CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with Type 2 diabetes on hypoglycaemic medications, fasting of any type increased the rate of hypoglycaemia. With education and medication reduction, fewer than expected hypoglycaemic events occurred. Although it was not possible to determine whether fasting on consecutive days increased the risk of hypoglycaemia, an acceptable rate was observed in both arms. Copyright Â© 2018 Diabetes UK.

T1  - Metformin is the key factor in elevated plasma growth differentiation factor-15 levels in type 2 diabetes: A nested, case-control study.
N2  - Produced as a tissue defence response to hypoxia and inflammation, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is elevated in people receiving metformin treatment. To gain insight into the relationship of GDF-15 with metformin and major cardiovascular risk factors, we analysed the data from the SUMMIT cohort (n = 1438), a four-centre, nested, case-control study aimed at verifying whether biomarkers of atherosclerosis differ according to the presence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While in univariate analysis, major cardiovascular risk factors, with the exception of gender and cholesterol, increased similarly and linearly across GDF-15 quartiles, the independent variables associated with GDF-15, both in participants with and without diabetes, were age, plasma creatinine, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, diuretic use, smoking exposure and glycated haemoglobin. In participants with diabetes, metformin treatment was associated with a 40% rise in GDF-15 level, which was independent of the other major factors, and largely explained their elevated GDF-15 levels. The relatively high GDF-15 bioavailability might partly explain the protective cardiovascular effects of metformin. Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T1  - Association of vitamin B12 deficiency in people with type 2 diabetes on metformin and without metformin: a multicenter study, Karachi, Pakistan.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on metformin and without metformin., METHODOLOGY: Between May 2018 and January 2019, this prospective multicenter observational study recruited participants from seven centers in four provinces of Pakistan (Sindh, Punjab, Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). Participants with T2DM treated with metformin for >2 years and those not on metformin underwent assessment of hemoglobin, vitamin B12, homocysteine and diabetic neuropathy (vibration perception threshold (VPT) >15V) and painful diabetic neuropathy (Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) >=4) and Diabetic Neuropathy Symptom (DNS) score >=1., RESULTS: Of 932 subjects, 645 (69.2%) were treated with metformin, while 287 (30.8%) were not on metformin. Overall, B12 deficiency (<200 pg/mL) was significantly higher in metformin users of 25 (3.9%), compared with non-metformin users of 6 (2.1%), while B12 insufficiency (200-300 pg/mL) was significantly lower in metformin users of 117 (18.4%) compared with non-metformin users of 80 (27.9%). Subjects with B12 deficiency and insufficiency with hyperhomocysteinemia (>=15) were found in 19 (76%) micromol/L and 69 (60.5%) micromol/L in metformin users compared with 6 (100%) micromol/L and 57 (73.1%) mumol/L in non-metformin users, respectively. VPT>25 and DN4 score >=4 were significantly higher in B12-deficient metformin users compared with non-metformin users. Similarly, DNS score >=1 was non-significantly higher in B12-deficient metformin users compared with non-metformin users., CONCLUSION: This study shows that vitamin B12 insufficiency was frequently found in our population and may progress into B12 deficiency. It is also associated with neuropathy in subjects on metformin. Further interventional studies to assess the benefit of B12 treatment on painful neuropathy in patients on metformin may be warranted. B12 levels may be checked in people with T2DM using metformin for >2 years. Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

T1  - General practice (GP) level analysis shows that patients' own perceptions of support within primary care as reported in the GP patient survey (GPPS) are as important as medication and services in improving glycaemic control.
N2  - BACKGROUND: The way that GP practices organize their services impacts as much on glycaemia in type 2 diabetes as does prescribing., AIM: Our aim was to evaluate the link between patients' own perception of support within primary care and the % patients at each GP practice at target glycaemic control (TGC) and at high glycaemic risk (HGR)., DESIGN AND SETTING: Utilisation of National Diabetes Audit (NDA) available data combined with the General practitioner patient survey (GPPS)., METHOD: The NDA 2016_17 published data on numbers of type 2 patients, levels of local diabetes services and the target glycaemic control (TGC) % and high glycaemic risk (HGR) % achieved. The GPPS 2017 published % "No" responses from long term condition (LTC) patients to the question "In the last 6 months, had you enough support from local services or organisations to help manage LTCs?". Multivariate regression was used on the set of indicators capturing patients' demographics and services provided., RESULTS: 6498 practices were included (with more than 2.5 million T2DM patients) and median values with band limits that included 95% practices for % "No" response to the question above was 12% (2%-30%), for TGC 67% (54%-78%) and for HGR 6% (2%-13%). The model accounted for 25% TGC variance and 26% HGR variance. The standardised beta values shown as (TGC/HGR) (+=more people; -=less people) for older age (+0.24/-0.25), sulphonylurea use (-0.21/+0.14), greater social disadvantage (-0.09/+0.21), GPPS Support %No (-0.08/+0.12), %Completion 8 checks (+0.09/-0.12) and metformin use (+0.11/-0.05)., CONCLUSION: The relation between the person with diabetes and clinician in primary care is shown to be quantitatively potentially as important in influencing glycaemic outcome as the services provided and medication prescribed. We suggest that all of us in who work in the health care system can bear this in mind in our everyday work. Copyright Â© 2019 Primary Care Diabetes Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Add-on therapy in metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes at moderate cardiovascular risk: a nationwide study.
N2  - BACKGROUND: In randomised clinical trials, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduced cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at high cardiovascular risk, as compared to standard care. However, data comparing these agents in patients with T2D who are at moderate risk is sparse., METHODS: From Danish national registries, we included patients with T2D previously on metformin monotherapy, who started an additional glucose-lowering agent [GLP-1 RA, SGLT-2 inhibitor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, sulfonylurea (SU), or insulin] in the period 2010-2016. Patients with a history of cardiovascular events [heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke] were excluded. Patients were followed for up to 2 years. Cause-specific adjusted Cox regression models were used to compare the risk of hospitalisation for HF, a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (MI, stroke or cardiovascular death), and all-cause mortality for each add-on therapy. Patients who initiated DPP-4 inhibitors were used as reference., RESULTS: The study included 46,986 T2D patients with a median age of 61 years and of which 59% were male. The median duration of metformin monotherapy prior to study inclusion was 5.3 years. Add-on therapy was distributed as follows: 13,148 (28%) GLP-1 RAs, 2343 (5%) SGLT-2 inhibitors, 15,426 (33%) DPP-4 inhibitors, 8917 (19%) SUs, and 7152 (15%) insulin. During follow-up, 623 (1.3%, range 0.8-2.1%) patients were hospitalised for HF-hazard ratios (HR) were 1.11 (95% CI 0.89-1.39) for GLP-1 RA, 0.84 (0.52-1.36) for SGLT-2 inhibitors, 0.98 (0.77-1.26) for SU and 1.54 (1.25-1.91) for insulin. The composite MACE endpoint occurred in 1196 (2.5%, range 1.5-3.6%) patients, yielding HRs of 0.82 (0.69-0.97) for GLP-1 RAs, 0.79 (0.56-1.12) for SGLT-2 inhibitors, 1.22 (1.03-1.49) for SU and 1.23 (1.07-1.47) for insulin. 1865 (3.9%, range 1.9-9.0%) died from any cause during follow-up. HRs for all-cause mortality were 0.91 (0.78-1.05) for GLP-1 RAs, 0.79 (0.58-1.07) for SGLT-2 inhibitors, 1.13 (0.99-1.31) for SU and 2.33 (2.08-2.61) for insulin., CONCLUSION: In a nationwide cohort of metformin-treated T2D patients and no history of cardiovascular events, the addition of either GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2 inhibitor to metformin treatment was associated with a similar risk of hospitalisation for HF and death, and a lower risk of MACE for GLP-1 RA when compared with add-on DPP-4 inhibitors. By contrast, initiation of treatment with SU and insulin were associated with a higher risk of MACE. Additionally, insulin was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for HF.

T1  - Effect of Cichorium intybus seeds supplementation on the markers of glycemic control, oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid profile in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized, double-blind placebo study.
N2  - Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that aqueous extract of Cichorium intybus seeds (AECIS) would have add-on beneficial effect in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this double-blind randomized clinical study, 150 subjects were enrolled to assess the add-on efficacy and safety of AECIS in T2DM patients. The subjects were randomized (1:1) to the AECIS (n = 51) and placebo (n = 49) groups. The subjects in both groups continued to take prescribed doses of metformin. The standardization of AECIS was carried out by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and phytochemical analysis. The mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level in the AECIS and placebo groups at baseline was 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. Mean values of HbA1c at the end of 12 weeks of intervention were 7.42% in the AECIS group (a reduction of 1.18% from baseline) and 8.4% in the placebo group (mean reduction of 0.1% from baseline). Besides, significant reduction in inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypertriglyceridemia was seen in the AECIS group (p < .05). The study shows for the first time that AECIS supplementation ameliorates the disease progression and it is beneficial as a potential adjunct dietary supplement for the management of T2DM.

T1  - Impact of Insulin and Metformin Versus Metformin Alone on beta-Cell Function in Youth With Impaired Glucose Tolerance or Recently Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Pediatric type 2 diabetes prevalence is increasing, with beta-cell dysfunction key in its pathogenesis. The RISE Pediatric Medication Study compared two approaches-glargine followed by metformin and metformin alone-in preserving or improving beta-cell function in youth with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes during and after therapy withdrawal., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-one pubertal, overweight/obese 10-19-year-old youth with IGT (60%) or type 2 diabetes of <6 months duration (40%) were randomized to either 3 months of insulin glargine with a target glucose of 4.4-5.0 mmol/L followed by 9 months of metformin or to 12 months of metformin alone. beta-Cell function (insulin sensitivity paired with beta-cell responses) was assessed by hyperglycemic clamp at baseline, 12 months (on treatment), and 15 months (3 months off treatment)., RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between treatment groups at baseline, 12 months, or 15 months in beta-cell function, BMI percentile, HbA1c, fasting glucose, or oral glucose tolerance test 2-h glucose results. In both treatment groups, clamp-measured beta-cell function was significantly lower at 12 and 15 months versus baseline. HbA1c fell transiently at 6 months within both groups. BMI was higher in the glargine followed by metformin versus metformin alone group between 3 and 9 months. Only 5% of participants discontinued the interventions, and both treatments were well tolerated., CONCLUSIONS: In youth with IGT or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes, neither 3 months of glargine followed by 9 months of metformin nor 12 months of metformin alone halted the progressive deterioration of beta-cell function. Alternate approaches to preserve beta-cell function in youth are needed. Copyright Â© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

T1  - Effects of Dapagliflozin on 24-Hour Glycemic Control in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and measures of short-term glycemia do not fully capture daily patterns in plasma glucose dynamics. This study evaluated 24-h glycemic profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiated on dapagliflozin treatment using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)., METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter parallel-design 4-week study compared dapagliflozin (10 mg/d; n = 50) with placebo (n = 50) in adult patients with T2D uncontrolled (HbA1c 7.5%-10.5%) on either stable doses of metformin monotherapy (>=1500 mg/d) or insulin (>=30 U/d with or without up to two oral antidiabetes drugs). CGM was used to measure 24-h glycemic profiles for 7 days pretreatment and during week 4 of treatment. The primary outcome was change from baseline in 24-h mean glucose (MG) at week 4., RESULTS: The 24-h MG decreased 18.2 mg/dL with dapagliflozin and increased 5.8 mg/dL with placebo (P < 0.001). The proportion of time spent in the target glucose range (70-180 mg/dL) increased significantly with dapagliflozin versus placebo (69.6% vs. 52.9%; P < 0.001), with a small (0.3%) increase in time spent in the hypoglycemic range (<70 mg/dL), driven by those on background insulin therapy. Dapagliflozin reduced postprandial glucose and significantly decreased overall glucose variability. Few events of symptomatic hypoglycemia occurred. The most common adverse event was urinary tract infection (6% in each treatment arm)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin improved measures of glycemic control and variability as assessed by CGM. Glycemic improvements were more pronounced in the group on background metformin than those receiving basal insulin.

T1  - Adding fast-acting insulin aspart to basal insulin significantly improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: A randomized, 18-week, open-label, phase 3 trial (onset 3).
N2  - AIM: To confirm glycaemic control superiority of mealtime fast-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) in a basal-bolus (BB) regimen vs basal-only insulin., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, 18-week trial (51 sites; 6 countries), adults (n = 236) with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D; mean glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c] +/- SD: 7.9% +/- 0.7% [63.1 +/- 7.5 mmol/mol]) receiving basal insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs underwent 8-week optimization of prior once-daily basal insulin followed by randomization 1:1 to either a BB regimen with faster aspart (n = 116) or continuation of once-daily basal insulin (n = 120), both with metformin. Primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline after 18 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included: postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) change and overall PPG increment (all meals); weight; treatment-emergent adverse events; hypoglycaemic episodes., RESULTS: HbA1c decreased from 7.9% (63.2 mmol/mol) to 6.8% (50.7 mmol/mol; BB group) and from 7.9% (63.2 mmol/mol) to 7.7% (60.7 mmol/mol; basal-only group); estimated treatment difference [95% confidence interval] -0.94% [-1.17; -0.72]; -10.3 mmol/mol [-12.8; -7.8]; P < .0001. Reductions from baseline in overall mean 2-hour PPG and overall PPG increment for all meals (self-measured plasma glucose profiles) were statistically significant in favour of BB treatment ( P < .0001). Severe/blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemia rate (12.8 vs 2.0 episodes per patient-years of exposure), total daily insulin (1.2 vs 0.6 U/kg) and weight gain (1.8 vs 0.2 kg) were greater with BB than with basal-only treatment., CONCLUSIONS: In T2D, faster aspart in a BB regimen provided superior glycaemic control as compared with basal-only insulin, but with an increase in the frequency of hypoglycaemia and modest weight gain.

T1  - Effect of canagliflozin on N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure according to baseline use of glucose-lowering agents.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of a deterioration in heart failure (HF) and mortality in patients with a broad range of cardiovascular risks. Recent guidelines recommend considering the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and HF, irrespective of their glycemic control status and background use of other glucose-lowering agents including metformin. However, only a small number of studies have investigated whether the effects of SGLT2 inhibitor in these patients differ by the concomitant use of other glucose-lowering agents., METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of the CANDLE trial (UMIN000017669), an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial. The primary aim of the analysis was to assess the effect of 24 weeks of treatment with canagliflozin, relative to glimepiride, on N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration in patients with T2D and clinically stable chronic HF. In the present analysis, the effect of canagliflozin on NT-proBNP concentration was assessed in the patients according to their baseline use of other glucose-lowering agents., RESULTS: Almost all patients in the CANDLE trial presented as clinically stable (New York Heart Association class I to II), with about 70% of participants having HF with a preserved ejection fraction phenotype (defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction >= 50%) at baseline. Of the 233 patients randomized to either canagliflozin (100 mg daily) or glimepiride (starting dose 0.5 mg daily), 85 (36.5%) had not been taking any glucose-lowering agents at baseline (naive). Of the 148 patients who had been taking at least one glucose-lowering agent at baseline (non-naive), 44 (29.7%) and 127 (85.8%) had received metformin or a dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, respectively. The group ratio (canagliflozin vs. glimepiride) of proportional changes in the geometric means of NT-proBNP concentration was 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 1.18, p = 0.618) for the naive subgroup, 0.92 (95% CI 0.79 to1.07, p = 0.288) for the non-naive subgroup, 0.90 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.20, p = 0.473) for the metformin-user subgroup, and 0.91 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.08, p = 0.271) for the DPP-4 inhibitor-user subgroup. No heterogeneity in the effect of canagliflozin, relative to glimepiride, on NT-proBNP concentration was observed in the non-naive subgroups compared to that in the naive subgroup., CONCLUSION: The impact of canagliflozin treatment on NT-proBNP concentration appears to be independent of the background use of diabetes therapy in the patient population examined.

T1  - Effectiveness and Safety of Adding Basal Insulin Glargine in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Exhibiting Inadequate Response to Metformin and DPP-4 Inhibitors with or without Sulfonylurea.
N2  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of adding basal insulin to initiating dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor and metformin and/or sulfonylurea (SU) in achieving the target glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)., METHODS: This was a single-arm, multicenter, 24-week, open-label, phase 4 study in patients with inadequately controlled (HbA1c >=7.5%) T2DM despite the use of DPP-4 inhibitor and metformin. A total of 108 patients received insulin glargine while continuing oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving HbA1c <=7.0%. Other glycemic profiles were also evaluated, and the safety endpoints were adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycemia., RESULTS: The median HbA1c at baseline (8.9%; range, 7.5% to 11.1%) decreased to 7.6% (5.5% to 11.7%) at 24 weeks. Overall, 31.7% subjects (n=33) achieved the target HbA1c level of <=7.0%. The mean differences in body weight and fasting plasma glucose were 1.2+/-3.4 kg and 56.0+/-49.8 mg/dL, respectively. Hypoglycemia was reported in 36 subjects (33.3%, 112 episodes), all of which were fully recovered. There was no serious AE attributed to insulin glargine. Body weight change was significantly different between SU users and nonusers (1.5+/-2.5 kg vs. -0.9+/-6.0 kg, P=0.011)., CONCLUSION: The combination add-on therapy of insulin glargine, on metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors with or without SU was safe and efficient in reducing HbA1c levels and thus, is a preferable option in managing T2DM patients exhibiting dysglycemia despite the use of OADs.

T1  - Preventing type 2 diabetes: systematic review of studies of cost-effectiveness of lifestyle programmes and metformin, with and without screening, for pre-diabetes.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Explore the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and metformin in reducing subsequent incidence of type 2 diabetes, both alone and in combination with a screening programme to identify high-risk individuals., DESIGN: Systematic review of economic evaluations., DATA SOURCES AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Database searches (Embase, Medline, PreMedline, NHS EED) and citation tracking identified economic evaluations of lifestyle interventions or metformin alone or in combination with screening programmes in people at high risk of developing diabetes. The International Society for Pharmaco-economics and Outcomes Research's Questionnaire to Assess Relevance and Credibility of Modelling Studies for Informing Healthcare Decision Making was used to assess study quality., RESULTS: 27 studies were included; all had evaluated lifestyle interventions and 12 also evaluated metformin. Primary studies exhibited considerable heterogeneity in definitions of pre-diabetes and intensity and duration of lifestyle programmes. Lifestyle programmes and metformin appeared to be cost effective in preventing diabetes in high-risk individuals (median incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 7490/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 8428/QALY, respectively) but economic estimates varied widely between studies. Intervention-only programmes were in general more cost effective than programmes that also included a screening component. The longer the period evaluated, the more cost-effective interventions appeared. In the few studies that evaluated other economic considerations, budget impact of prevention programmes was moderate (0.13%-0.2% of total healthcare budget), financial payoffs were delayed (by 9-14 years) and impact on incident cases of diabetes was limited (0.1%-1.6% reduction). There was insufficient evidence to answer the question of (1) whether lifestyle programmes are more cost effective than metformin or (2) whether low-intensity lifestyle interventions are more cost effective than the more intensive lifestyle programmes that were tested in trials., CONCLUSIONS: The economics of preventing diabetes are complex. There is some evidence that diabetes prevention programmes are cost effective, but the evidence base to date provides few clear answers regarding design of prevention programmes because of differences in denominator populations, definitions, interventions and modelling assumptions.

T1  - Metformin Use Is Associated With Longer Progression-Free Survival of Patients With Diabetes and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Receiving Everolimus and/or Somatostatin Analogues.
N2  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Metformin seems to have anticancer effects. However, it is not clear whether use of glycemia and metformin affect outcomes of patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). We investigated the association between glycemia and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with pNETs treated with everolimus and/or somatostatin analogues, as well as the association between metformin use and PFS time., METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 445 patients with advanced pNET treated at 24 medical centers in Italy from 1999 through 2015. Data on levels of glycemia were collected at time of diagnosis of pNET, before treatment initiation, and during treatment with everolimus (with or without somatostatin analogues), octreotide, or lanreotide. Diabetes was defined as prior or current use of glycemia control medication and/or fasting plasma glucose level >= 126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c >= 6.5% (48 mmol/L), or a random sample of plasma glucose >= 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), with reported classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. Patients were assigned to groups based on diagnosis of diabetes before or during antitumor therapy. PFS was compared between patients with vs without diabetes. Among patients with diabetes, the association between metformin use and PFS was assessed. We performed sensitivity and landmark analyses to exclude patients who developed diabetes while receiving cancer treatment and to exclude a potential immortal time bias related to metformin intake., RESULTS: PFS was significantly longer in patients with diabetes (median, 32.0 months) than without diabetes (median, 15.1 months) (hazard ratio for patients with vs without diabetes, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.80; P = .0002). PFS of patients treated with metformin was significantly longer (median PFS, 44.2 months) than for patients without diabetes (hazard ratio for survival of patients with diabetes receiving metformin vs without diabetes, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.62; P < .00001) and longer than for patients with diabetes receiving other treatments (median PFS, 20.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.69; P < .0001). In multivariable analysis, adjusted for other factors associated with outcomes, metformin was associated with longer PFS but level of glycemia was not. Metformin was associated with increased PFS of patients receiving somatostatin analogues and in those receiving everolimus, with or without somatostatin analogues. Sensitivity and landmark analyses produced similar results., CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective study of patients with pNETs, we found a significant association between metformin use and longer PFS.

T1  - Antidiabetic Treatment in Patients at High Risk for a Subsequent Keratinocyte Carcinoma.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Metformin and sulfonylureas are the most commonly prescribed drugs used for the treatment of type II diabetes. Type II diabetes has been linked to the development of keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), consisting of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Previously we have demonstrated lower risk for a subsequent KC in metformin users. In this study, we aim to investigate the association between sulfonylureas use and the development of KC in patients with KC history. We performed a retrospective cohort study of the Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial, which was a randomized double-blind vehicle-control cream originally investigating the effect of 5-fluorouracil on KC development. 932 patients with a history of KC were enrolled (98% male, 99% white, median age of 70 years) and followed for a median duration of 2.8 years. 153 patients were on metformin and 94 on sulfonylureas. We performed a survival analysis with cox regression and controlled for body mass index and known predictors: number of prior BCCs and age (for BCC) and for number of prior SCCs (invasive and in situ), number of actinic keratoses at baseline (for SCC). Sulfonylurea-users com-pared to non-users had a HR of 0.67 (CI: 0.40&ndash;1.56; P=0.49) and 0.94 (CI: 0.63&ndash;1.40; P= 0.77), for SCC and BCC, respectively. Diabetic patients at high risk for KC might benefit from the use of metformin versus sulfonylureas. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(5):502-505. doi:10.36849/JDD.6087.

T1  - Effects of Sitagliptin as Monotherapy and Add-On to Metformin on Weight Loss among Overweight and Obese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Sitagliptin is known as an antidiabetic agent inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase-4. Although sitagliptin may influence weight, controversial results have been reported, and there is no general agreement on this issue. Therefore, this study assessed the effect of sitagliptin as monotherapy and add-on therapy to metformin on weight reduction in overweight or obese cases with type 2 diabetes., METHODS: We reviewed the following databases to identify all relevant papers published until 1st April 2021: Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. The research included all clinical trials investigating the effect of sitagliptin in obese or overweight adult patients with type 2 diabetes without any language restriction., RESULTS: In total, eighteen randomized controlled trials with 2009 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Results showed supplementation of sitagliptin has led to weight loss for sitagliptin treated (MD -0.99; 95% CI; (-1.87, -0.12); p=0.026)) and sitagliptin+metformin treated groups (MD -1.09; 95% CI; (-1.69, -0.49); p<0.001)). Also, the intervention has influenced body mass index in sitagliptin treated (MD -0.23; 95% CI; (-0.45, 0.02); p=0.033)) and sitagliptin+metformin treated groups (MD -0.52; 95% CI; (-0.96, 0.08); p=0.020)) comparing to placebo., CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that sitagliptin administration with or without metformin might reduce the body weight and body mass index if these drugs are taken for more than 6 months.

T1  - Association between combined treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin for type 2 diabetes mellitus on fracture risk: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
N2  - This study analyzed the effects of combination therapy with sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and metformin on fracture risk. Summarizing available randomized controlled trials, we found that SGLT2is combined with metformin therapy did not influence fracture risk compared with metformin monotherapy or other comparators in patients with T2DM., INTRODUCTION: No study is available evaluating the association between sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in combination with metformin use and fracture risk. Our study aimed to investigate the fracture risk of combination therapy with SGLT2is and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)., METHODS: PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov site, and the Cochrane Library databases were scrutinized for all eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The summarized odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Review Manager 5.3 software., RESULTS: A total of 25 RCTs involving 19,500 participants with T2DM were included in our studies. There were 88 fracture cases in the SGLT2is in combination with metformin therapy group and 79 in the control group. SGLT2is combined with metformin use did not influence fracture risk compared with metformin monotherapy or other comparators in patients with T2DM (OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.71-1.32). After stratification by drug type, follow-up time, control regimen, and type of fracture, the upshots were still stable., CONCLUSION: SGLT2is and metformin combination therapy did not influence fracture risk compared with metformin monotherapy or other comparators in patients with T2DM., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020168435.

T1  - Statistical power considerations in genotype-based recall randomized controlled trials.
N2  - Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are often underpowered for validating gene-treatment interactions. Using published data from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), we examined power in conventional and genotype-based recall (GBR) trials. We calculated sample size and statistical power for gene-metformin interactions (vs. placebo) using incidence rates, gene-drug interaction effect estimates and allele frequencies reported in the DPP for the rs8065082 SLC47A1 variant, a metformin transported encoding locus. We then calculated statistical power for interactions between genetic risk scores (GRS), metformin treatment and intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) given a range of sampling frames, clinical trial sample sizes, interaction effect estimates, and allele frequencies; outcomes were type 2 diabetes incidence (time-to-event) and change in small LDL particles (continuous outcome). Thereafter, we compared two recruitment frameworks: GBR (participants recruited from the extremes of a GRS distribution) and conventional sampling (participants recruited without explicit emphasis on genetic characteristics). We further examined the influence of outcome measurement error on statistical power. Under most simulated scenarios, GBR trials have substantially higher power to observe gene-drug and gene-lifestyle interactions than same-sized conventional RCTs. GBR trials are becoming popular for validation of gene-treatment interactions; our analyses illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this design.

T1  - Double-blind, randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of early initiation of sitagliptin during metformin uptitration in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes: The CompoSIT-M study.
N2  - AIMS: To characterize the glycaemic efficacy and safety of initiation of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin during metformin dose escalation in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) not at glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) goal on a sub-maximal dose of metformin., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study participants with HbA1c >=58 mmol/mol and <=97 mmol/mol (>=7.5% and <=11.0%) while on 1000 mg/d metformin were randomized to sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo. All were to uptitrate metformin to 2000 mg/d. A longitudinal data analysis model was used to test the primary hypothesis that sitagliptin is superior to placebo when initiated during uptitration of metformin in reducing HbA1c at week 20. [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02791490, EudraCT: 2015-004224-59] RESULTS: A total of 458 participants (mean HbA1c 71.1 mmol/mol [8.7%], T2D duration 6.3 years) were treated. After 20 weeks, the least squares (LS) mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were -12.1 mmol/mol (-14.0, -10.1) (-1.10% [-1.28, -0.93]) and -7.6 mmol/mol (-9.6, -5.6) (-0.69% [-0.88, -0.51]) with sitagliptin and placebo, respectively; the between-group difference in LS mean changes from baseline HbA1c was -4.5 mmol/mol (-6.5, -2.5) (-0.41% [-0.59, -0.23]); P < 0.001. The likelihood of having HbA1c <53 mmol/mol (<7.0%) at week 20 was higher in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group in the overall population (relative risk 1.7, P = 0.002) and in those with a baseline HbA1c >=69 mmol/mol (>=8.5%) (relative risk 2.4, P = 0.026). There were no notable differences between groups with regard to adverse events overall, hypoglycaemia events, changes in body weight or other safety variables., CONCLUSION: In participants not at HbA1c goal on a sub-maximal dose of metformin, addition of sitagliptin at the time of metformin dose uptitration improved glycaemic response and HbA1c goal attainment, with similar safety and tolerability, compared to metformin uptitration alone.

T1  - Phase III Study on Efficacy and Safety of Triple Combination (Exenatide/Metformin/Biphasic Insulin Aspart) Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
N2  - Exenatide, metformin (MET), and biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIA30) have been widely used in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, each of these medications has significant adverse effects, which limit their utilization. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple combination (exenatide/metformin/biphasic insulin aspart) therapy for T2DM. Two hundred patients with poorly controlled T2DM were randomly divided into the low-dose (0.5 mug exenatide, 0.05 U.kg.d BIA30, and 0.01 g MET twice daily) and normal-dose (2 mug exenatide, 0.2 U.kg.d BIA30, and 0.05 g MET twice daily) groups for 48 weeks of treatment. Of note, 82 and 90 individuals from the low-dose and normal-dose groups, respectively, completed the study. The levels of adiponectin, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and resistin were measured. The normal-dose treatment was more effective at lowering hemoglobin A1c levels than the low-dose therapy (HbA1c changes of -2.5 +/- 0.19% and -0.8 +/- 0.07%, respectively) after 48 weeks. The maximum weight decrease was 0.9 kg in the low-dose group and 4.0 kg in the normal-dose group. The triple combination therapy increased the levels of insulin sensitivity and adiponectin and reduced the levels of C-reactive protein, resistin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. No significant difference in the adverse effects was found between the low-dose and normal-dose groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the investigated triple combination therapy for T2MD is therefore an effective and safe therapeutic strategy.

T1  - The efficacy and safety of liraglutide added to metformin in patients with diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
N2  - Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has showed favorable effects in the glycaemic control and weight reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of liraglutide added to metformin with other treatments in patients with T2DM. A systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane library databases were performed. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with T2DM who received the combination treatment of liraglutide and metformin. Pooled estimates were performed using a fixed-effects model or random-effects model. A total of nine RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Compared with control (placebo, sitagliptin, glimepiride, dulaglutide, insulin glargine, and NPH), liraglutide in combination with metformin resulted in significant reductions in HbA1c, bodyweight, FPG, and PPG, and similar reductions in SBP, and DBP. Moreover, liraglutide combined with metformin did not increase the risk of hypoglycemia, but induced a higher incidence of gastrointestinal disorders. In conclusion, this meta-analysis confirmed the use of liraglutide as add-on to metformin appeared to be effective and safe for patients with T2DM. However, considering the potential limitations in this study, more large-scale, well-conducted RCTs are needed to identify our findings.

T1  - Association of Intensive Lifestyle and Metformin Interventions With Frailty in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome of decreased physiologic reserve and resistance to stressors that results in increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes with aging. Diabetes and hyperglycemia are established risk factors for frailty. We sought to examine whether the odds of frailty among individuals at high risk of diabetes randomized to treatment with intensive lifestyle (ILS), metformin, or placebo differed after long-term follow-up., METHOD: The sample comprised participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial, who continued follow-up in the DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) and completed frailty assessments in DPPOS Years 8 (n = 2385) and 10 (n = 2289), approximately 12 and 14 years after DPP randomization. Frailty was classified using Fried Frailty Phenotype criteria. GEE models adjusting for visit year with repeated measures pooled for Years 8 and 10 were used to estimate pairwise odds ratios (ORs) between ILS, metformin, and placebo for the outcomes of frail and prefrail versus nonfrail., RESULTS: Frailty prevalence by treatment group was ILS = 3.0%, metformin = 5.4%, placebo = 5.7% at Year 8, and ILS = 3.6%, metformin = 5.3%, placebo = 5.4% at Year 10. Odds ratios (95% CI) estimated with GEE models were ILS versus placebo, 0.62 (0.42-0.93), p = .022; metformin versus placebo, 0.99 (0.69-1.42), p = .976; and ILS versus metformin, 0.63 (0.42-0.94), p = .022. Odds of being frail versus nonfrail were 37% lower for ILS compared to metformin and placebo., CONCLUSIONS: Early ILS intervention, at an average age of about 50 years, in persons at high risk of diabetes may reduce frailty prevalence in later life. Metformin may be ineffective in reducing frailty prevalence., CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION NUMBERS: NCT00004992 (DPP) and NCT00038727 (DPPOS). Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2021.

T1  - Treatment with the glucagon receptor antagonist LY2409021 increases ambulatory blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes.
N2  - AIMS: To assess the effect of LY2409021 on systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with type 2 diabetes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 6-week, randomized, crossover study evaluated the effects of once-daily administration of LY2409021 20 mg vs those of placebo on SBP, diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) in 270 subjects treated with diet/exercise +/- metformin. Other measures included changes in glycemic control, serum lipids, and hepatic safety markers., RESULTS: At 6 weeks of LY2409021 treatment, 24-hour mean SBP was increased, with a least squares mean (LSM) difference of 2.26 mm Hg vs placebo (95% CI: 1.11, 3.40; P < .001). The 24-hour mean DBP and MAP also increased, with LSM differences of 1.37 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.66, 2.08; P < .001) and 1.67 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.86, 2.47; P < .001) vs placebo, respectively. At week 6, LY2409021 treatment reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, with an LSM difference of -0.49% (-5.4 mmol/mol) (95% CI: -0.56%, -0.42% [-6.1, -4.6 mmol/mol]; P < .001) vs placebo. Mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.3% (56 mmol/mol). Small but significant changes in serum lipid and aminotransferase levels were observed with LY2409021 treatment (all P < .05 vs placebo)., CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant increases in BP, MAP and serum lipid levels were observed with LY2409021 treatment at a dose that lowered HbA1c and glucose levels. These effects may limit the clinical utility of LY2409021 as a chronic treatment for type 2 diabetes. Copyright Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T1  - Comparative efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide and SGLT-2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy: a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment intensification with additional anti-diabetic agents is recommended in type 2 diabetes (T2D) for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. The present network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated comparative efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) in T2D patients inadequately controlled with metformin., METHODS: Randomized controlled trials with >=20 weeks duration were searched in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL. Primary efficacy outcomes were: change from baseline in HbA1c, weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), post-prandial blood glucose (PPG), and fasting blood glucose (FPG). Treatment effects at 26 (+/-4) weeks were compared using Bayesian NMAs. Meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were used to address the trial heterogeneity., RESULTS: Eight trials were found eligible for this NMA. Statistically significant reductions in HbA1c were observed with both 1.0 mg and 0.5 mg doses of once-weekly semaglutide when compared to SGLT-2is. The mean differences in change from baseline in HbA1c for once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg vs SGLT-2is ranged from -0.66% for canagliflozin 300 mg (95% Credible Intervals [CrI]: -0.82, -0.50%) to -1.11% for dapagliflozin 5 mg (95% CrI: -1.37, -0.85%). Once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg performed significantly better than all SGLT-2is of interest in reducing weight and improving FPG levels: however, SBP reduction was not statistically differentiable. Results of sensitivity analysis and meta-regressions aligned with base-case results. NMAs were not possible for PPG and safety outcomes, due to lack of data., CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide treatment is significantly better compared to SGLT-2is in achieving adequate glycemic control in T2D patients inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

T1  - Evidence in support of the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy study groups' criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus worldwide in 2019.
N2  - Gestational diabetes mellitus, the most frequent medical complication of pregnancy, affects 5-6% of women in the United States with the use of the currently predominant Carpenter-Coustan criteria, which still represent the preferred approach of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Alternative criteria proposed by the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups would likely increase gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence to 15-20%, because of both a 1-step testing policy and the requirement for only 1 elevated glucose value for diagnosis. Increasing gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence relates to older maternal age and the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity. This increased gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence is consistent with 29.3% prevalence of prediabetes and 4.5% prevalence of known diabetes outside pregnancy in US adults from 20-44 years of age. Gestational diabetes mellitus according to the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups criteria is associated with almost twice the risk of large-for-gestational-age babies, increased fetal adiposity, neonatal hyperinsulinemia and preeclampsia, and a 50% higher risk of preterm delivery and shoulder dystocia. The recent publication of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Follow Up Study provides further evidence regarding the influence of gestational diabetes mellitus on long-term maternal and infant health. This study clearly demonstrates that hyperglycemia in pregnancy, untreated and identified post hoc by the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups criteria, carries a 41.5% risk of maternal prediabetes (odds ratio, 3.72; 95% confidence interval, 3.09-4.47) and 10.7% risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 7.63; 95% confidence interval, 5.33-10.95) after 11.4 years of follow up. Gestational diabetes mellitus was also associated with higher rates of childhood overweight and obesity (prevalence 39.3% with maternal gestational diabetes mellitus; odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-2.44). This article places these findings in the context of other recent studies that have demonstrated that interventions that include lifestyle measures and/or metformin offer a >50% reduction in the risk of women with gestational diabetes mellitus experiencing the development of overt diabetes mellitus after their index gestational diabetes mellitus pregnancy. Although prevention of obesity and prediabetes in offspring by pregnancy treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus has not been demonstrated to date, we argue that the immediate pregnancy benefits and opportunities for long-term improvements in maternal health justify a reevaluation of the current ambivalent approach taken by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis, which currently allow for a choice of alternative criteria. The Carpenter-Coustan or National Diabetes Data Group criteria, listed as preferred criteria by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, markedly limit the frequency of gestational diabetes mellitus in comparison with the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups criteria and limit the opportunity for immediate and long-term follow up and treatment. We consider that new information from the Hyperglycemia and Pregnancy Outcome Follow Up Study and other recent publications on long-term maternal and offspring risk provides compelling arguments for a more comprehensive approach to the promotion of maternal and infant health through all the life cycle.

T1  - Updates on Managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Natural Products: Towards Antidiabetic Drug Development.
N2  - Over the years, natural products have shown success as antidiabetics in in vitro, in vivo studies and clinical trials. Because natural product-derived drugs are more affordable and effective with fewer side-effects compared to conventional therapies, pharmaceutical research is increasingly leaning towards the discovery of new antidiabetic drugs from natural products targeting pathways or components associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) pathophysiology. However, the drug discovery process is very lengthy and costly with significant challenges. Therefore, various techniques are currently being developed for the preclinical research phase of drug discovery with the aim of drug development with less time and efforts from natural products. In this review, we have provided an update on natural products including fruits, vegetables, spices, nuts, beverages and mushrooms with potential antidiabetic activities from in vivo, in vitro and clinical studies. Synergistic interactions between natural products and antidiabetic drugs, and potential antidiabetic active compounds from natural products are also documented to pave the way for combination treatment and new drug discovery, respectively. Additionally, a brief idea of the drug discovery process along with the challenges that arise during drug development from natural products and the methods to conquer those challenges are discussed to create a more convenient future drug discovery process.

T1  - Fasting in diabetes treatment (FIT) trial: study protocol for a randomised, controlled, assessor-blinded intervention trial on the effects of intermittent use of a fasting-mimicking diet in patients with type 2 diabetes.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Caloric restriction is an effective way to treat Type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, chronic and severe restriction of food intake is difficult to sustain and is known to promote slower metabolism. Intermittent and frequent fasting can exert similar metabolic effects, but may be even more challenging for most patients. A fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) is low in calories, sugars and proteins, but includes relatively high levels of plant based complex carbohydrates and healthy fats. The metabolic effects of such a diet mimic the benefits of water-only fasting. The effects of a FMD applied periodically in T2D patients are still unknown. The Fasting In diabetes Treatment (FIT) trial was designed to determine the effect of intermittent use (5 consecutive days a month during a year) of a FMD in T2D patients on metabolic parameters and T2D medication use compared to usual care., METHODS: One hundred T2D patients from general practices in the Netherlands with a BMI >= 27 kg/m2, treated with lifestyle advice only or lifestyle advice plus metformin, will be randomised to receive the FMD plus usual care or usual care only. Primary outcomes are HbA1c and T2D medication dosage. Secondary outcomes are anthropometrics, blood pressure, plasma lipid profiles, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, metabolomics, microbiome composition, MRI data including cardiac function, fat distribution and ectopic fat storage, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility in clinical practice., DISCUSSION: This study will establish whether monthly 5-day cycles of a FMD during a year improve metabolic parameters and/or reduce the need for medication in T2D. Furthermore, additional health benefits and the feasibility in clinical practice will be measured and a cost-effectiveness evaluation will be performed., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT03811587. Registered 21th of January, 2019; retrospectively registered.

T1  - Durability of Triple Combination Therapy Versus Stepwise Addition Therapy in Patients With New-Onset T2DM: 3-Year Follow-up of EDICT.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term efficacy of initiating therapy with metformin/pioglitazone/exenatide in patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) versus sequential addition of metformin followed by glipizide and insulin., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Drug-naive patients (N = 318) with new-onset T2DM were randomly assigned to receive for 3 years either 1) combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, and exenatide (triple therapy) or 2) sequential addition of metformin followed by glipizide and insulin (conventional therapy) to maintain HbA1c at <6.5% (48 mmol/mol). Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function were measured at baseline and 3 years. The primary outcome was the difference in HbA1c between the groups at 3 years., RESULTS: Baseline HbA1c +/- SEM values were 9.0% +/- 0.2% and 8.9% +/- 0.2% in the triple therapy and conventional therapy groups, respectively. The decrease in HbA1c resulting from triple therapy was greater at 6 months than that produced by conventional therapy (0.30% [95% CI 0.21-0.39]; P = 0.001), and the HbA1c reduction was maintained at 3 years in patients receiving triple therapy compared with conventional therapy (6.4% +/- 0.1% and 6.9% +/- 0.1%, respectively), despite intensification of antihyperglycemic therapy in the latter. Thus, the difference in HbA1c between the two treatment groups at 3 years was 0.50% (95% CI 0.39-0.61; P < 0.0001). Triple therapy produced a threefold increase in insulin sensitivity and 30-fold increase in beta-cell function. In conventional therapy, insulin sensitivity did not change and beta-cell function increased by only 34% (both P < 0.0001 vs. triple therapy)., CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy with agents that improve insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in patients with new-onset T2DM produces greater, more durable HbA1c reduction than agents that lower glucose levels without correcting the underlying metabolic defects.

T1  - Metformin and Gastrointestinal Cancer Development in Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes: A Population-Based Study in Korea.
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Clinical studies have produced conflicting results on the effects of metformin on gastrointestinal cancer development. We aimed to investigate the association between metformin use and stomach, colon, liver, and pancreatic cancer development among patients with newly diagnosed, drug-naive type 2 diabetes., METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated propensity score-matched patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Metformin users were categorized into tertiles according to the cumulative dose or duration of metformin treatment, and the risks of gastrointestinal cancers were compared., RESULTS: Metformin users had reduced risks of developing stomach cancer (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.841, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.797-0.887), colon cancer (HR: 0.865, 95% CI: 0.822-0.91), and liver cancer (HR: 0.709, 95% CI: 0.675-0.746; P < 0.001). However, metformin users did not have a reduced overall risk of pancreatic cancer (HR: 1.335, 95% CI: 1.209-1.475; P < 0.001). The risks tended to decrease at higher cumulative doses and durations of metformin use, with significantly reduced risks of all 4 cancers at the highest cumulative dose (>=1,200,000 mg) and the longest duration (>=2,000 days) of metformin use., DISCUSSION: This population-based data suggest that metformin could be associated with reductions in the risks of stomach, colon, and liver cancers, as well a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer in some subgroups. Metformin has benefit as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. A further role in cancer risk reduction could be studied in controlled trials.

T1  - A clinical update on metformin and lung cancer in diabetic patients.
N2  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is frequently increased in many countries and become a serious health problem worldwide. Diabetes is associated with dysfunction of different organs such as heart, eyes, blood vessels, nerves, and kidneys. There is a strong connection between diabetes and cancer. Metformin is one of the most commonly prescribed oral antidiabetic medicines and it is suggested as the first-line therapy due to its comparatively safe, inexpensive, effective and well-tolerated. Some of the in vitro and in vivo investigations proved that metformin may have a direct anticancer action by preventing the proliferation of malignant cells and formations of the colony, inducing arrest of cell cycle and apoptosis and suppressing tumor growth. The antiproliferative mechanism of metformin alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutic agents is complex and involves several beneficial roles. In this regard, clinical studies are required to explain these roles. In the coming future, the use of metformin, alone or in combination with current chemotherapy, might be a conventional approach to effectually manage lung cancer. This mini-review provides a critical overview of currently available clinical trials investigating the effects of metformin in lung cancer.

T1  - [Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Recent Publications and New Drugs].
N2  - Since 2013 several placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trails on new classes of glucose-lowering agents in addition to standard care have been reported. These trails were designed to demonstrate non-inferiority to placebo with regard to cardiovascular safety for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high cardiovascular risk.For the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-receptor agonists liraglutide and semaglutide as well as for the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin statistically significant reductions of the primary composite outcome (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death) were demonstrated. Cardiovascular outcomes trails for the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors saxagliptin, alogliptin, and sitagliptin did not show statistically significant differences for major cardiovascular events between treatment and placebo groups. Therefore, for patients with established cardiovascular disease who do not achieve sufficient blood glucose control on metformin monotherapy GLP-1-receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors should be favoured for diabetes therapy intensification. However, the use of DPP-4 inhibitors should be considered for patients who are in need of a well-tolerated and safe oral glucose-lowering therapy. Copyright Â© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

T1  - Long-term treatment with metformin in type 2 diabetes and methylmalonic acid: Post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled 4.3year trial.
N2  - AIMS: Metformin treatment is associated with a decrease of serum vitamin B12, but whether this reflects tissue B12 deficiency is controversial. We studied the effects of metformin on serum levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA), a biomarker for tissue B12 deficiency, and on onset or progression of neuropathy., METHODS: In the HOME trial, 390 insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with metformin or placebo for 52months. In a post hoc analysis, we analyzed the association between metformin, MMA and a validated Neuropathy Score (NPS)., RESULTS: Metformin vs placebo increased MMA at the end of the study (95%CI: 0.019 to 0.055, p=0.001). Mediation analysis showed that the effect of metformin on the NPS consisted of a beneficial effect through lowering HbA1c (-0.020 per gram year) and an adverse effect through increasing MMA (0.042 per gram year), resulting in a non-significant net effect (0.032 per gram year, 95% CI: -0.121 to 0.182, p=0.34)., CONCLUSION: Metformin not only reduces serum levels of B12, but also progressively increases serum MMA. The increase of MMA in metformin users was associated with significant worsening of the NPS. These results provide further support that metformin-related B12 deficiency is clinically relevant. Monitoring of B12 in users of metformin should be considered. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Effects of Metformin on Left Ventricular Size and Function in Hypertensive Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Results of a Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter, Phase IV Trial.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Metformin is the most widely used oral antihyperglycemic agent for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite the possible benefits of metformin on diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF), acute or unstable HF remains a precaution for its use., OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present prospective randomized controlled trial was to assess whether metformin treatment has beneficial effects on patients with T2DM with hypertension without overt HF., METHODS: A total of 164 patients (92 males, 72 females; median age 66 years) were included in this study. Patients with T2DM with a history of hypertension were randomized 1:1 to treatment for 1 year with either metformin (metformin-treated group) or other hypoglycemic agents (control group). The primary endpoints were changes in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, left ventricular (LV) mass index, and indicators of LV diastolic function. We also evaluated changes in both clinical findings and blood laboratory examination data., RESULTS: We observed no significant changes between baseline and 1-year post-treatment in LV mass index, BNP levels, or E/e' (early diastolic transmitral flow velocity/early diastolic mitral annular velocity; an indicator of LV diastolic function) in either the metformin-treated (n = 83) or the control (n = 81) groups. The metformin-treated group had a significant reduction of body mass index (BMI) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), but the control group did not. We determined that renal function, including serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, deteriorated significantly in the control group but not in the metformin-treated group., CONCLUSION: LV mass and diastolic function were not affected after 1 year of metformin treatment in patients with T2DM. However, we observed benefits in terms of reductions in both BMI and LDL-C levels and preservation of renal function., TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000006504. Registered 7 October 2011.

T1  - Reduced mortality from lower respiratory tract disease in adult diabetic patients treated with metformin.
N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRD) increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, which in turn may worsen lung function. Metformin, a common antidiabetic with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, may improve respiratory outcomes. Therefore, we examined the association of metformin use with the risk of mortality from CLRD., METHODS: We analysed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1988-1994 and 1999-2010 for participants aged 40 years or older who had diabetes and were followed up for mortality through 2011. Information on prescription medicine was collected at baseline and CLRD-related mortality during follow-up was defined using the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to determine the mortality hazard ratio (HR) associated with metformin use, adjusting for relevant covariates., RESULTS: A total of 5266 participants with a median follow-up of 6.1 years were included. The prevalence of metformin use was 31.9% and 1869 participants died during follow-up, including 72 of CLRD. In the adjusted Cox proportional regression analysis, metformin was associated with a decreased risk of CLRD mortality in the overall population (HR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.15-0.99) and among participants with baseline CLRD (HR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.10-0.93), after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, cigarette smoking, body mass index, current asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), insulin and other diabetic medications, and glycohaemoglobin level. We found no association between other antidiabetic medications and CLRD mortality., CONCLUSION: In this sample representative of the U.S. population, metformin was associated with lower CLRD mortality in adults with diabetes.

T1  - Metformin for early comorbid glucose dysregulation and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a pilot double-blind randomized clinical trial.
N2  - Patients with schizophrenia have exceedingly high rates of metabolic comorbidity including type 2 diabetes and lose 15-20 years of life due to cardiovascular diseases, with early accrual of cardiometabolic disease. In this study, thirty overweight or obese (Body Mass Index (BMI) > 25) participants under 40 years old with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and early comorbid prediabetes or type 2 diabetes receiving antipsychotic medications were randomized, in a double-blind fashion, to metformin 1500 mg/day or placebo (2:1 ratio; n = 21 metformin and n = 9 placebo) for 4 months. The primary outcome measures were improvements in glucose homeostasis (HbA1c, fasting glucose) and insulin resistance (Matsuda index-derived from oral glucose tolerance tests and homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)). Secondary outcome measures included changes in weight, MRI measures of fat mass and distribution, symptom severity, cognition, and hippocampal volume. Twenty-two patients (n = 14 metformin; n = 8 placebo) completed the trial. The metformin group had a significant decrease over time in the HOMA-IR (p = 0.043) and fasting blood glucose (p = 0.007) vs. placebo. There were no differences between treatment groups in the Matsuda index, HbA1c, which could suggest liver-specific effects of metformin. There were no between group differences in other secondary outcome measures, while weight loss in the metformin arm correlated significantly with decreases in subcutaneous, but not visceral or hepatic adipose tissue. Our results show that metformin improved dysglycemia and insulin sensitivity, independent of weight loss, in a young population with prediabetes/diabetes and psychosis spectrum illness, that is at extremely high risk of early cardiovascular mortality.

T1  - Effect of short-term prednisone on beta-cell function in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy subjects.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: For those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), impact of short-term high-dose glucocorticoid exposure on beta-cell function is unknown. This study aims to compare the impact on beta-cell function and insulin resistance of prednisone 40 mg between adults with newly diagnosed T2DM and healthy adults., METHODS: Five adults with T2DM and five healthy adults, all between 18-50 years, were enrolled. T2DM diagnosis was less than one year prior, HbA1c<75 mmol/mol (9.0%), with metformin treatment only. Pre- and post-therapy testing included 75-g oral glucose tolerance, plasma glucose, C-peptide, and insulin. Intervention therapy was prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days., RESULTS: Upon therapy completion, HOMA-IR did not increase or differ between groups. Percentile difference for HOMA-%B and insulinogenic index in those with T2DM was significantly lower statistically (50.4% and 69.2% respectively) compared to healthy subjects (19% and 32.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the assumption that insulin resistance is the main driver of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia, results indicate that decreased beta-cell insulin secretion is the more likely cause in those with T2DM. This is evidenced by significant drops in C-peptide AUC and HOMA-%B and increased glucose AUC in T2DM group only. These results may be caused by increased beta-cell fragility along with reduced recovery ability after glucocorticoid exposure. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03661684.

T1  - Effect of Additional Oral Semaglutide vs Sitagliptin on Glycated Hemoglobin in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Uncontrolled With Metformin Alone or With Sulfonylurea: The PIONEER 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.
N2  - Importance: Phase 3 trials have not compared oral semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, with other classes of glucose-lowering therapy., Objective: To compare efficacy and assess long-term adverse event profiles of once-daily oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin, 100 mg added on to metformin with or without sulfonylurea, in patients with type 2 diabetes., Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase 3a trial conducted at 206 sites in 14 countries over 78 weeks from February 2016 to March 2018. Of 2463 patients screened, 1864 adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea were randomized., Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive once-daily oral semaglutide, 3 mg (n = 466), 7 mg (n = 466), or 14 mg (n = 465), or sitagliptin, 100 mg (n = 467). Semaglutide was initiated at 3 mg/d and escalated every 4 weeks, first to 7 mg/d then to 14 mg/d, until the randomized dosage was achieved., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the key secondary end point was change in body weight, both from baseline to week 26. Both were assessed at weeks 52 and 78 as additional secondary end points. End points were tested for noninferiority with respect to HbA1c (noninferiority margin, 0.3%) prior to testing for superiority of HbA1c and body weight., Results: Among 1864 patients randomized (mean age, 58 [SD, 10] years; mean baseline HbA1c, 8.3% [SD, 0.9%]; mean body mass index, 32.5 [SD, 6.4]; n=879 [47.2%] women), 1758 (94.3%) completed the trial and 298 prematurely discontinued treatment (16.7% for semaglutide, 3 mg/d; 15.0% for semaglutide, 7 mg/d; 19.1% for semaglutide, 14 mg/d; and 13.1% for sitagliptin). Semaglutide, 7 and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, significantly reduced HbA1c (differences, -0.3% [95% CI, -0.4% to -0.1%] and -0.5% [95% CI, -0.6% to -0.4%], respectively; P < .001 for both) and body weight (differences, -1.6 kg [95% CI, -2.0 to -1.1 kg] and -2.5 kg [95% CI, -3.0 to -2.0 kg], respectively; P < .001 for both) from baseline to week 26. Noninferiority of semaglutide, 3 mg/d, with respect to HbA1c was not demonstrated. Week 78 reductions in both end points were statistically significantly greater with semaglutide, 14 mg/d, vs sitagliptin., Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea, oral semaglutide, 7 mg/d and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, resulted in significantly greater reductions in HbA1c over 26 weeks, but there was no significant benefit with the 3-mg/d dosage. Further research is needed to assess effectiveness in a clinical setting., Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02607865.

T1  - Effects of probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1 on the gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin: An open-label, single-arm, exploratory research trial.
N2  - AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Metformin is associated with the risk of gastrointestinal complications, and probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1 (BBG9-1) can improve the symptoms of diarrhea. This study aimed to clarify the effects of probiotic BBG9-1 on the gastrointestinal symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients using metformin., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label single-arm exploratory study, 40 patients (mean age 64.0 +/- 9.4 years) were given probiotic BBG9-1 for 10 weeks. Changes in the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale total score, which was the primary end-point, gastrointestinal symptom rating scale subscale scores, glycated hemoglobin levels and gut microbiota after the administration of probiotic BBG9-1 were evaluated by the Student's t-test., RESULTS: The gastrointestinal symptom rating scale total score significantly improved (from 2.02 +/- 0.51 to 1.59 +/- 0.43, change, -0.43 +/- 0.49, P < 0.001). Furthermore, all gastrointestinal symptom rating scale subscale scores, including diarrhea (from 2.32 +/- 1.14 to 1.89 +/- 0.99, change, -0.42 +/- 0.95, P = 0.007) and constipation (from 3.00 +/- 1.16 to 2.20 +/- 1.07, change, -0.80 +/- 1.19, P < 0.001), scores also significantly improved. However, the glycated hemoglobin levels did not change (from 7.0 +/- 0.7 to 7.0 +/- 0.6%, change, 0.0 +/- 0.4, P = 0.91). The relative abundance of the genus Sutterella decreased by the use of probiotic BBG9-1 (from 0.011 +/- 0.009 to 0.008 +/- 0.006, change, -0.003 +/- 0.006, P = 0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients treated with metformin showed significant improvement in all gastrointestinal symptom rating scores after using probiotic BBG9-1 without changing the glucose control. This study showed the potential usefulness of probiotic BBG9-1 for improving gastrointestinal symptoms, including constipation and diarrhea, in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients treated with metformin.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment (PIONEER 5): a placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 3a trial.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Oral semaglutide is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is commonly associated with renal impairment, restricting treatment options. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment., METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, phase 3a trial was undertaken at 88 sites in eight countries. Patients aged 18 years and older, with type 2 diabetes, an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30-59 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and who had been receiving a stable dose of metformin or sulfonylurea, or both, or basal insulin with or without metformin for the past 90 days were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of an interactive web-response system, with stratification by glucose-lowering medication and renal function, to receive oral semaglutide (dose escalated to 14 mg once daily) or matching placebo for 26 weeks, in addition to background medication. Participants and site staff were masked to assignment. Two efficacy-related estimands were defined: treatment policy (regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication) and trial product (on treatment without rescue medication) in all participants randomly assigned. Endpoints were change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c (primary endpoint) and bodyweight (confirmatory secondary endpoint), assessed in all participants with sufficient data. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02827708, and the European Clinical Trials Registry, number EudraCT 2015-005326-19, and is now complete., FINDINGS: Between Sept 20, 2016, and Sept 29, 2017, of 721 patients screened, 324 were eligible and randomly assigned to oral semaglutide (n=163) or placebo (n=161). Mean age at baseline was 70 years (SD 8), and 168 (52%) of participants were female. 133 (82%) participants in the oral semaglutide group and 141 (88%) in the placebo group completed 26 weeks on treatment. At 26 weeks, oral semaglutide was superior to placebo in decreasing HbA1c (estimated mean change of -1.0 percentage point (SE 0.1; -11 mmol/mol [SE 0.8]) vs -0.2 percentage points (SE 0.1; -2 mmol/mol [SE 0.8]); estimated treatment difference [ETD]: -0.8 percentage points, 95% CI -1.0 to -0.6; p<0.0001) and bodyweight (estimated mean change of -3.4 kg [SE 0.3] vs -0.9 kg [SE 0.3]; ETD, -2.5, 95% CI -3.2 to -1.8; p<0.0001) by the treatment policy estimand. Significant differences were seen for the trial product estimand: mean change in HbA1c -1.1 percentage points (SE 0.1; -12 mmol/mol [SE 0.8] versus -0.1 percentage points (SE 0.1; -1 mmol/mol [SE 0.8]; ETD -1.0 percentage points, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.8; p<0.0001); mean change in bodyweight -3.7 kg (SE 0.3) versus -1.1 kg (SE 0.3; ETD -2.7 kg, 95% CI -3.5 to -1.9; p<0.0001). More patients taking oral semaglutide than placebo had adverse events (120 [74%] of 163 vs 105 [65%] of 161), and discontinued treatment as a result (24 [15%] vs eight [5%]). Gastrointestinal events, mainly mild-to-moderate nausea, were more common with oral semaglutide than with placebo. Three deaths occurred during the treatment period that were not condsidered to be treatment related, one in the semaglutide group and two in the placebo group., INTERPRETATION: Oral semaglutide was effective in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment, potentially providing a new treatment option for this population. Safety, including renal safety, was consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class., FUNDING: Novo Nordisk A/S. Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - Outcomes after surgery in patients with diabetes who used metformin: a retrospective cohort study based on a real-world database.
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Limited information was available regarding the perioperative outcomes in patients with and without use of metformin. This study aims to evaluate the complications and mortality after major surgery in patients with diabetes who use metformin., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a real-world database of Taiwan's National Health Insurance from 2008 to 2013, we conducted a matched cohort study of 91 356 patients with diabetes aged >20 years who used metformin and later underwent major surgery. Using a propensity score-matching technique adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, medical condition, surgery type, and anesthesia type, 91 356 controls who underwent surgery but did not use metformin were selected. Logistic regression was used to calculate the ORs with 95% CIs for postoperative complications and 30-day mortality associated with metformin use., RESULTS: Patients who used metformin had a lower risk of postoperative septicemia (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98), acute renal failure (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.96), and 30-day mortality (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88) compared with patients who did not use metformin, in both sexes and in every age group. Metformin users who underwent surgery also had a decreased risk of postoperative intensive care unit admission (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.62) and lower medical expenditures (p<0.0001) than non-use controls., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with diabetes, those who used metformin and underwent major surgery had a lower risk of complications and mortality compared with non-users. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to show direct evidence of how metformin improves perioperative outcomes. Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

T1  - Antisense Inhibition of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B With IONIS-PTP-1BRx Improves Insulin Sensitivity and Reduces Weight in Overweight Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of IONIS-PTP-1BRx, a second-generation 2'-O-methoxyethyl antisense inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, as add-on therapy in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea therapy., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, overweight and obese patients (BMI >=27 kg/m2) with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c >=7.5% [58 mmol/mol] and <=10.5% [91 mmol/mol]) on a stable dose of metformin alone or with sulfonylurea were randomized 2:1 to IONIS-PTP-1BRx 200 mg (n = 62) or placebo (n = 30) once weekly for 26 weeks., RESULTS: Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.6% (70 mmol/mol) and 8.7% (72 mmol/mol) in placebo and active treatment, respectively. At week 27, IONIS-PTP-1BRx reduced mean HbA1c levels by -0.44% (-4.8 mmol/mol; P = 0.074) from baseline and improved leptin (-4.4 ng/mL; P = 0.007) and adiponectin (0.99 mug/mL; P = 0.026) levels compared with placebo. By week 36, mean HbA1c was significantly reduced (-0.69% [-7.5 mmol/mol]; P = 0.034) and accompanied by reductions in fructosamine (-33.2 mumol/L; P = 0.005) and glycated albumin (-1.6%; P = 0.031) versus placebo. Despite both treatment groups receiving similar lifestyle counseling, mean body weight significantly decreased from baseline to week 27 with IONIS-PTP-1BRx versus placebo (-2.6 kg; P = 0.002) independent of HbA1c reduction (R2 = 0.0020). No safety concerns were identified in the study., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, IONIS-PTP-1BRx treatment for 26 weeks produced prolonged reductions in HbA1c, improved medium-term glycemic parameters, reduced leptin and increased adiponectin levels, and resulted in a distinct body weight-reducing effect.

T1  - Structural Alteration of Gut Microbiota during the Amelioration of Human Type 2 Diabetes with Hyperlipidemia by Metformin and a Traditional Chinese Herbal Formula: a Multicenter, Randomized, Open Label Clinical Trial.
N2  - Accumulating evidence implicates gut microbiota as promising targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). With a randomized clinical trial, we tested the hypothesis that alteration of gut microbiota may be involved in the alleviation of T2DM with hyperlipidemia by metformin and a specifically designed herbal formula (AMC). Four hundred fifty patients with T2DM and hyperlipidemia were randomly assigned to either the metformin- or AMC-treated group. After 12 weeks of treatment, 100 patients were randomly selected from each group and assessed for clinical improvement. The effects of the two drugs on the intestinal microbiota were evaluated by analyzing the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene by Illumina sequencing and multivariate statistical methods. Both metformin and AMC significantly alleviated hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia and shifted gut microbiota structure in diabetic patients. They significantly increased a coabundant group represented by Blautia spp., which significantly correlated with the improvements in glucose and lipid homeostasis. However, AMC showed better efficacies in improving homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and plasma triglyceride and also exerted a larger effect on gut microbiota. Furthermore, only AMC increased the coabundant group represented by Faecalibacterium spp., which was previously reported to be associated with the alleviation of T2DM in a randomized clinical trial. Metformin and the Chinese herbal formula may ameliorate type 2 diabetes with hyperlipidemia via enriching beneficial bacteria, such as Blautia and Faecalibacterium spp. IMPORTANCE Metabolic diseases such as T2DM and obesity have become a worldwide public health threat. Accumulating evidence indicates that gut microbiota can causatively arouse metabolic diseases, and thus the gut microbiota serves as a promising target for disease control. In this study, we evaluated the role of gut microbiota during improvements in hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia by two drugs: metformin and a specifically designed Chinese herbal formula (AMC) for diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia. Both drugs significantly ameliorated blood glucose and lipid levels and shifted the gut microbiota. Blautia spp. were identified as being associated with improvements in glucose and lipid homeostasis for both drugs. AMC exerted larger effects on the gut microbiota together with better efficacies in improving HOMA-IR and plasma triglyceride levels, which were associated with the enrichment of Faecalibacterium spp. In brief, these data suggest that gut microbiota might be involved in the alleviation of diabetes with hyperlipidemia by metformin and the AMC herbal formula.

T1  - Tolerability and Efficacy of Ipragliflozin in The Management of Inadequately Controlled Type 2 Diabetes mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
N2  - AIM: Ipragliflozin is a new antidiabetic agent that works through enhancing renal glucose excretion. We aim to synthesize evidence from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the safety and efficacy of ipragliflozin in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)., METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central register of clinical trials using relevant keywords. Records were screened for eligible studies and data were extracted and synthesized using Review Manager Version 5.3 for windows. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted., RESULTS: We included 13 RCTs (N=2535 patients) in the final analysis. The overall effect estimates favoured ipragliflozin 50mg monotherapy group over placebo in terms of: HbA1c (Standardized mean difference (SMD)=-1.20%, 95% Confidence interval (95% CI)=[-1.47, -0.93]; p<0.001), fasting plasma glucose (SMD=-1.30 mg/dL, 95% CI [-1.93, -0.67]; p<0.001), fasting serum insulin (SMD=-1.64 muU/mL, 95% CI [-2.70, -0.59]; p=0.002), and body weight (SMD=-0.85 kg, 95% CI [-1.19, -0.51]; p<0.001). Similarly, better glycemic control and significant body weight reduction compared to placebo were attained in ipragliflozin 50 mg combination with metformin, insulin with/without dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sulfonylurea, and pioglitazone. Ipragliflozin, either alone or in combination, exhibits acceptable safety profile., CONCLUSION: The presented meta-analysis provides class one evidence that ipragliflozin is safe and effective in the management of T2DM either as monotherapy or an add-on.

T1  - Validity of the Good Practice Guidelines: The example of type 2 diabetes.
N2  - AIMS: To assess the methodological quality of the systematic reviews of the literature for Good Practice Guidelines (GPGs) for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D)., METHODS: The GPGs on treatment of T2D from May 2012 onwards were searched on PubMed, the Guidelines International Network, the National Guidelines Clearing House and the Infobanque des guides de pratique clinique. Quality of the GPGs was assessed by means of grading of levels of evidence, strength of recommendations, statements pertaining to systematic reviews, description of their methods, search for Randomized Controlled Trials meta-analyses, and citations from three meta-analyses which contested the strategy of intensive glycemic control and metformin as first-line treatment., RESULTS: Fiflty-two GPGs were included; half of them had and applied a system of grading and strength of recommendation and 58% stated they had carried out a systematic review. Only one GPG cited the three meta-analyses. Three quarters of the GPGs failed to detail their bibliographic research methods., CONCLUSION: The GPGs for treatment of T2D were of poor quality and their methodological rigor was insufficient. Even though the meta-analyses had a higher level of evidence, they were seldom cited. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T1  - A time to revisit the two oldest prandial anti-diabetes agents: acarbose and repaglinide.
N2  - PURPOSE: Compared with newer prandial anti-diabetes agents, repaglinide and acarbose are unique in being globally available in generic versions, being oral, and being the cheapest of all. The aim of this study was to compare their efficacy when used alone or in combination., METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, prospective study, 358 recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, who on a combined therapy with metformin and insulin glargine had a fasting plasma glucose (FGP) of <7.2 mmol/L but a 2-h postprandial plasma glucose (2hPPG) >10 mmol/L, were assigned to three groups of additional treatment with either repaglinide, acarbose, or repaglinide-plus-acarbose for 4 months., RESULTS: With intention-to-treat analysis, 63% of repaglinide group, 45.4 percent of acarbose group, and 75.7% of repaglinide-plus-acarbose group reached the primary endpoint of 2hPPG < 10 mmol/L while maintaining FPG < 7.2 mmol/L. Treatment adherence rate was 75.6% with repaglinide, 61.4% with acarbose, and 81.3% with repaglinide-plus-acarbose (p = 0.001). Among the groups, weight was significantly lower in acarbose group (p < 0.05). Twenty-one percent of repaglinide patients, 4.9% of acarbose subjects, and 10.3% of repaglinide-plus-acarbose cases reported at least one episode of hypoglycemia (p < 0.005). HbA1C and basal insulin requirement were significantly lower in repaglinide group (p = 0.004, p = 0.0002). Triglycerides were lowest in acarbose group (p = 0.005)., CONCLUSIONS: Both acarbose and repaglinide were vastly effective in lowering postprandial hyperglycemia of recently diagnosed T2D. When combined, they were even more efficacious and the disease had a better outcome. Compared with newer peers, these two are particularly useful where and when cost consideration in diabetes treatment is a prime concern.

T1  - Effect of Metformin and Lifestyle Interventions on Mortality in the Diabetes Prevention Program and Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether metformin or lifestyle modification can lower rates of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the Diabetes Prevention Program and Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1996 to 1999, 3,234 adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes were randomized to an intensive lifestyle intervention, masked metformin, or placebo. Placebo and lifestyle interventions stopped in 2001, and a modified lifestyle program was offered to everyone, but unmasked study metformin continued in those originally randomized. Causes of deaths through 31 December 2018 were adjudicated by blinded reviews. All-cause and cause-specific mortality hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazards regression models and Fine-Gray models, respectively., RESULTS: Over a median of 21 years (interquartile range 20-21), 453 participants died. Cancer was the leading cause of death (n = 170), followed by cardiovascular disease (n = 131). Compared with placebo, metformin did not influence mortality from all causes (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.79, 1.25]), cancer (HR 1.04 [95% CI 0.72, 1.52]), or cardiovascular disease (HR 1.08 [95% CI 0.70, 1.66]). Similarly, lifestyle modification did not impact all-cause (HR 1.02 [95% CI 0.81, 1.28]), cancer (HR 1.07 [95% CI 0.74, 1.55]), or cardiovascular disease (HR 1.18 [95% CI 0.77, 1.81]) mortality. Analyses adjusted for diabetes status and duration, BMI, cumulative glycemic exposure, and cardiovascular risks yielded results similar to those for all-cause mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Cancer was the leading cause of mortality among adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Although metformin and lifestyle modification prevented diabetes, neither strategy reduced all-cause, cancer, or cardiovascular mortality rates.

T1  - Antidiabetic and antiosteoporotic pharmacotherapies for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes-induced bone disease: protocol for two network meta-analyses.
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at risk for a variety of severe debilitating effects. One of the most serious complications experienced by patients with T2DM are skeletal diseases caused by changes in the bone microenvironment. As a result, patients with T2DM are at risk for higher prevalence of fragility fractures. There are a variety of treatments available for counteracting this effect. Some antidiabetic medications, such as metformin, have been shown to have a positive effect on bone health without the addition of additional drugs into patients' treatment plans. Chinese randomised controlled trial (RCT) studies have also proposed antiosteoporotic pharmacotherapies as a viable alternative treatment strategy. Previous network meta-analyses (NMAs) and meta-analyses regarding this topic did not include all available RCT trials, or only performed pairwise comparisons. We present a protocol for a two-part NMA that incorporates all available RCT data to provide the most comprehensive ranking of antidiabetics (part I) and antiosteoporotic (part II) pharmacotherapies in terms of their ability to decrease fracture incidences, increase bone mineral density (BMD) and improve indications of bone turnover markers (BTMs) in adult patients with T2DM., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica Database, PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Chinese literature sources (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP Information, Wanfang Data, Wanfang Med Online) for RCTs, which fit our criteria. We will include adult patients with T2DM who have taken antidiabetics (part I) or antiosteoporotic (part II) therapies with relevant outcome measures in our study. We will perform title/abstract and full-text screening as well as data extraction in duplicate. Risk of bias will be evaluated in duplicate for each study, and the quality of evidence will be examined using Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis in accordance to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. We will use R and gemtc to perform the NMA. We will report changes in BMD and BTMs in either weighted or standardised mean difference, and we will report fracture incidences as ORs. We will use the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve scores to provide numerical estimates of the rankings of interventions., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will not require ethics approval. The findings of the two-part NMA will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences. We aim to produce the most comprehensive quantitative analysis regarding the management of T2DM bone disease. Our analysis should be able to provide physicians and patients with up-to-date recommendations for antidiabetic medications and antiosteoporotic pharmacotherapies for maintaining bone health in patients with T2DM., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019139320.

T1  - Glycaemic control and mortality in older people with type 2 diabetes: The Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II.
N2  - AIM: To investigate whether tight glycaemic control achieved with metformin, insulin or sulphonylurea-based pharmacotherapy increases all-cause mortality in older people with type 2 diabetes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of individuals with known diabetes recruited between 2008 and 2011 and followed until 2016. The impact of baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) on mortality hazards was investigated in participants aged >=75 years. Proportional hazards models for time to death were constructed from the baseline clinical assessment, then the variables of interest (HbA1c, treatment category and their interactions) were entered., RESULTS: There were 367 participants (mean age 80.1 +/- 3.9 years, median [interquartile range] HbA1c 50 [45-56] mmol/mol or 6.7 [6.3-7.3]%) who were followed for a median (interquartile range) 6.7 (4.5-7.7) years, during which 40.9% of the participants died. At baseline, 60.4% were on metformin-based treatment, 35.3% on sulphonylurea-based treatment and 23.2% on treatment including insulin. Baseline HbA1c was significantly associated with mortality in a model that included interactions between HbA1c and the three treatment-based groups compared with non-pharmacological treatment. The metformin treatment group had higher mortality when HbA1c levels were <48 mmol/mol (<6.5%) and the sulphonylurea and insulin treatment groups had higher mortality when HbA1c levels were <52 mmol/mol (<7.0%), with hazard ratios of 2.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-4.97), 2.49 (95% CI 1.14-5.44) and 2.22 (95% CI 1.12-4.43), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Tight glycaemic control may be hazardous in older people with type 2 diabetes when achieved with pharmacotherapy with metformin, and especially with insulin or sulphonylureas. These data confirm that overtreatment is likely to be an important clinical problem in this vulnerable population. Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T1  - Concurrent Nivolumab and Metformin in Diabetic Cancer Patients: Is It Safe and More Active?.
N2  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Recent evidence suggests potential synergistic antitumor effects of the combination of programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors with the oral hypoglycemic agent metformin. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and activity of metformin combined with nivolumab in diabetic cancer patients., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced melanoma, renal cell carcinoma or lung cancer receiving nivolumab with concurrent diabetes treated with metformin were retrospectively collected. The primary endpoint was the safety of nivolumab plus metformin combination., RESULTS: We collected 40 patients with solid tumors who received metformin for concomitant diabetes and nivolumab as anticancer therapy in four Italian Hospitals. The concomitant use of nivolumab and metformin was well tolerated; adverse events (AEs) of any grade occurred in 75% of patients (mainly fatigue, pruritus, rash, and asthenia). Grade 3 AEs occurred only in 20% of cases; no grade 4 AEs were observed. A statistically significant correlation was found between higher doses of metformin (>1,000 mg daily) and longer progression-free survival (p=0.021), overall survival (p=0.037) and higher overall response rate., CONCLUSION: The combination of nivolumab and metformin was safe and might have an antitumor activity, supporting further investigations on the synergistic antitumor effect of this combination.

T1  - Current and experimental drug therapy for the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome.
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects 8-13% of reproductive-age women. Irregular periods, hirsutism, or infertility are the most common clinical presentations of patients affected by PCOS. This syndrome is also linked to metabolic abnormalities such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and obesity. The optimal therapeutic approach is still unknown., AREAS COVERED: This narrative review offers an overview of the literature on current and experimental pharmacological options for treating PCOS and highlights ongoing clinical trials. Several electronic databases were searched and current research registers were analyzed to the present year. The papers selected for this review were critically analyzed, and all data available were summarized, organized, and explored to derive key information., EXPERT OPINION: The main goal of PCOS treatment is to obtain a metabolic and hormonal balance. Optimal PCOS therapy should be direct to the reproductive abnormalities and the entire spectrum of endocrine and metabolic complications that appear to have a long-term negative impact on PCOS patient health, as in post-menopausal period. The discovery of new mechanisms in PCOS pathogenesis will offer the possibility of testing new drug classes.

T1  - Effect of medication adherence on clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetes: analysis of the SIMPLE study.
N2  - Objective: Medication adherence is impacted by regimen complexity. The SIMPLE (Simple basal Insulin titration, Metformin Plus Liraglutide for type 2 diabetes with very Elevated HbA1c) study compared GLP1RA plus basal insulin (GLP1RA+BI) to basal-bolus insulin (BBI) regimen in participants with very uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This analysis aimed to evaluate medication adherence to GLP1RA+BI compared with BBI, the effect of adherence on clinical and patient-reported outcomes, and baseline predictors of adherence., Research design and methods: This was an analysis of the SIMPLE study based on prespecified outcome. The study took place in pragmatic, real-world setting. A total of 120 adults with T2DM and HgbA1c>=10% were randomized to detemir plus liraglutide, or detemir plus aspart before each meal; 6-month follow-up. The main outcomes evaluated were: adherence, HgbA1c, weight, quality of life, and hypoglycemia. Adherence rate was calculated for each study medication at each follow-up visit; participants were classified as >=80% or <80% adherent., Result: A higher percentage of participants in the GLP1RA+BI compared with the BBI group had >=80% adherence to detemir (59.3% vs 35.7%, p=0.02) as well as liraglutide versus aspart (57.4% vs 30.4%, p=0.007). Higher age was predictive of >=80% adherence (OR per 5-year increment=1.48, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.0, p=0.01). Higher adherence led to greater improvement in HbA1c and weight in both groups. Treatment with GLP1RA+BI compared with BBI led to greater improvement in HbA1c, weight, and quality of life and lower risk of hypoglycemia even after adjusting for the difference in adherence between groups., Conclusions: Adherence was higher with the simplified regimen of GLP1RA+BI compared with BBI. Greater adherence to the simpler regimen amplified the treatment effect on HbA1c, weight, quality of life, and risk of hypoglycemia, yet statistically significant greater benefits were noted even when adjusted for adherence., Trial registration number: NCT01966978.

T1  - Liraglutide as add-on to sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes: LIRA-ADD2SGLT2i, a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
N2  - AIM: To compare the effect of liraglutide or placebo added on to sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) +/- metformin on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes on a stable SGLT2i dose +/- metformin (with HbA1c 7.0%-9.5% and body mass index [BMI] >= 20 kg/m2 ) were randomized 2:1 to add-on liraglutide 1.8 mg/day or placebo in this parallel, double-blind, multinational trial. Primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints were changes in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 26, respectively. The proportions of patients achieving HbA1c (<7.0%) targets and safety events after week 26 were also assessed., RESULTS: Of 303 patients randomized (one in error), 280 completed treatment. Mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 with liraglutide (n = 202) and placebo (n = 100) were - 0.98% and - 0.30%, respectively (estimated treatment difference [ETD]: -0.68% [95% CI: -0.89, -0.48]; P < 0.001). Mean body weight changes from baseline were - 2.81 versus -1.99 kg, respectively (ETD: -0.82 kg [95% CI: -1.73, 0.09]; P = 0.077); 51.8% of liraglutide-treated patients achieved HbA1c < 7.0% versus 23.2% receiving placebo (odds ratio: 5.1 [95% CI: 2.67, 9.87]; P < 0.001). More patients treated with liraglutide reported >=1 treatment-emergent adverse events (66.3%) versus placebo (47.0%)., CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide significantly improved glycaemic control compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes, insufficiently controlled with SGLT2is with/without metformin, with no unexpected safety findings.

T1  - Comparison of Adherence to Glimepiride/Metformin Sustained Release Once-daily Versus Glimepiride/Metformin Immediate Release BID Fixed-combination Therapy Using the Medication Event Monitoring System in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.
N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the adherence of the glimepiride/metformin sustained release (GM-SR) once-daily fixed-dose combination and glimepiride/metformin immediate release (GM-IR) BID fixed-dose combination in type 2 diabetes therapies., METHODS: An open-label, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study was conducted at 11 hospitals in the Republic of Korea. A total of 168 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with >4 mg of glimepiride and 1000 mg of metformin by using free or fixed-dose combination therapy for at least 2 weeks were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive GM-SR 4/1000 mg once-daily or GM-IR 2/500 mg BID for 24 weeks. Adherence was compared by using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS)., FINDINGS: A significant difference in adherence was observed between the 2 groups. Overall adherence, defined by the number of container openings divided by the number of prescribed doses, was 91.7% in the GM-SR group and 88.6% in the GM-IR group (P < 0.001). The percentage of treatment days with the correct number of doses taken was 85.3% in the GM-SR group and 75.1% in the GM-IR group (P < 0.001). The percentage of missed doses was 11.7% in the GM-SR group and 15.3% in the GM-IR group (P < 0.001). The percentage of doses taken in the correct time window and therapeutic coverage were higher in the GM-SR group (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in glycosylated hemoglobin changes or number of adverse events between the 2 groups. A total of 168 patients randomized to receive GM-SR once daily (86 patients) or GM-IR twice daily (82 patients). Mean Age were 57.8 +/- 9.6 years old. Male : female ratio was 47.6 : 52.4 %. Body mass index were 66.3 +/- 12.0 kg/m2, Diabetes duration were 10.5 +/- 6.6 years., IMPLICATIONS: This study showed that patient adherence with GM-SR once daily was significantly better than with GM-IR BID.

T1  - Antidiabetic Drugs and Prostate Cancer Prognosis in a Finnish Population-Based Cohort.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Hyperinsulemia and glycemic control may play a role as prostate cancer prognostic factors, whereas use of certain antidiabetic drugs, that is metformin, could improve the prognosis. We examined the link between antidiabetic medication use and prostate cancer survival taking into account simultaneous use of multiple drugs., METHODS: The study cohort composed of 6,537 men in The Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer with prostate cancer diagnosed 1996 to 2009. Use of medication was attained from the nationwide prescription database of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Median follow-up was 9.2 years postdiagnosis. A total of 1,603 (24,5%) men had used antidiabetic medication. A total of 771 men died of prostate cancer during the follow-up. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression to evaluate the risk of prostate cancer death and onset of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with adjustment for prostate cancer clinical characteristics, comorbidities and use of other drugs. Separate analyses were further adjusted for blood glucose., RESULTS: Risk of prostate cancer death was higher among antidiabetic drug users overall (HR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.18-1.70) compared with nonusers, separately among insulin and metformin users. Adjustment for blood glucose level abolished the risk increase. Risk of ADT initiation was increased among the medication users (HR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.49)., CONCLUSIONS: Men with prostate cancer using antidiabetic medication are generally at increased risk of dying from prostate cancer compared with nonusers. The risk association is driven by underlying diabetes, as adjustment for blood glucose level ameliorates the risk increase., IMPACT: Type 2 diabetes should be considered as a risk factor when considering prostate cancer prognosis.

T1  - Novel antidiabetic drugs and risk of cardiovascular events in patients without baseline metformin use: a meta-analysis.
N2  - AIMS: To evaluate the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on major cardiovascular events (MACE) in metformin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D)., METHODS AND RESULTS: A meta-analysis was performed of randomized controlled clinical trials of GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors on T2D populations, after searching the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Controlled Trials databases. The primary endpoint was MACE. The secondary endpoint, explored in the subgroup of SGLT-2 inhibitors studies, was cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. A random-effects meta-analysis model was applied. Six eligible trials (three studies of SGLT-2 inhibitors and three trials of GLP-1RAs), including 13 049 patients, were identified and considered eligible for the analyses. The new antidiabetic drugs were associated with a significant reduction in MACE [odds ratio (OR): 0.80, 95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.93; I2: 53%]. The subgroup analysis showed the following findings: GLP-1RAs group, OR: 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.67-0.88); SGLT-2 inhibitors, OR: 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.63-1.15). SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a significant reduction in hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular mortality incidence (OR: 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.47-0.95; I2: 78%)., CONCLUSION: In this meta-analysis, new antidiabetic drugs reduced the incidence of MACE in metformin-naive T2D patients. The beneficial effect was especially observed in the GLP-1RAs subgroup. The use of SGLT-2 inhibitors was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. These results support the fact that metformin would not be indispensable to obtain positive cardiovascular effects when new antidiabetic drugs are administered.

T1  - Glucose lowering strategies and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes - teachings from the TOSCA.IT study.
N2  - TOSCA.IT is an institutional, non-industry-supported, head-to-head study comparing long term cardiovascular effects, efficacy and safety of two antidiabetes drugs (pioglitazone vs sulphonylureas) used in combination with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study results show that in the absence of clinically evident cardiovascular disease both treatment strategies represent suitable alternatives; however, in consideration of the greater durability of the metabolic effects, the lower risk of hypoglycemia and the potential benefit on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the combination of metformin and pioglitazone may be considered as the preferential therapeutic option. In this review the study is critically evaluated against the background of the evidence accumulated over the last decade on the impact of different glucose lowering drugs on cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes.

T1  - [Effect of metformin on colorectal carcinoma in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: a Markov model analysis].
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention effect of metformin in comparison with that of other T2DM medications from a Markov model perspective., METHODS: Literature concerning CRC morbidity of T2DM patients with metformin or other diabetes medications treatment was reviewed in PubMed and Cochrane Library database from September 2010 to December 2016., INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1)enrolled population was adult patients with T2DM but without CRC; (2) any of the parameters applied in our model was reported; (3) randomized clinical trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies. With CRC morbidity as endpoint, parameters were extracted to construct Markov model to assess CRC morbidity and cumulative tumor-free survival in each group over 11 years' follow-up period. Finally, Monte Carlo analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of parameter instability on the model., RESULTS: Seven literatures were recruited and 10 000 patients were virtually allocated for each arm. In contrast with non-metformin group, T2DM patients treated with metformin had a lower rate of CRC(1.670% vs. 2.146%, P=0.016). Moreover, cumulative tumor-free survival of metformin group was, slightly but significantly, better than that of non-metformin group (10.908 years vs. 10.882 years, P=0.000)., CONCLUSIONS: T2DM patients treated with metformin have a lower morbidity of CRC and a better cumulative tumor-free survival than those of non-metformin group. Large scale RCTs are needed to illustrate the role of metformin in the prevention of CRC.

T1  - Gestational weight gain in women with type 2 diabetes and perinatal outcomes: A secondary analysis of the metformin in women with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy (MiTy) trial.
N2  - AIMS: Our study assesses perinatal outcomes among women with type 2 diabetes, with gestational weight gain (GWG) within and outside of US Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines, by conducting a secondary analysis of the Metformin in Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy (MiTy) trial., METHODS: 460 participants were classified into three cohorts by total and weekly GWG (excessive, appropriate vs. restricted according to IOM). The primary outcome was birthweight z score, and secondary outcomes included both maternal and fetal outcomes., RESULTS: Women with restricted (total and weekly) GWG had lower birthweight z score, lower fetal birthweight, and lower neonatal body fat mass. Women with restricted weekly GWG had fewer LGA, extreme LGA, and lower neonatal body fat mass infants, but more SGA and preterm births. Women with excessive (total and weekly) GWG had higher maternal total insulin doses in the third trimester. Women with excessive weekly GWG had more preeclampsia and higher SGA., CONCLUSIONS: Restricted GWG among women with type 2 diabetes is associated with both benefits and harms. Both must be considered when counseling patients. Copyright Â© 2022. Published by Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Practical guidance for use of oral semaglutide in primary care: a narrative review.
N2  - As the cornerstone of type 2 diabetes (T2D) management within the community, primary care providers are now faced with the challenge of not only managing diabetes itself, but also preventing hypoglycemia and weight gain associated with intensive disease management, and reducing cardiovascular risk. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are well established as efficacious treatments for T2D, and the safety/tolerability profile of this drug class is well defined. However, despite their beneficial effects, GLP-1RAs are under-utilized, highlighting the need for novel approaches to increase their use in primary care. Oral semaglutide is the first oral GLP-1RA approved for the treatment of T2D, offering glucose lowering and body weight loss, a low risk of hypoglycemia, and no increase in cardiovascular risk. Oral semaglutide represents an additional treatment option for patients not achieving their glycemic goal despite treatment with metformin, either alone or with other hypoglycemic agents. Oral semaglutide has the potential to increase usage of GLP-1RAs in the primary care setting by addressing clinician and patient concerns about injections, and may facilitate earlier initiation of GLP-1RA therapy in T2D. Due to the formulation of oral semaglutide, clinicians need to be aware of specific considerations in order to ensure optimal use. Such considerations include dosing conditions and use of concomitant medications. This article provides practical guidance on the use of oral semaglutide in the primary care setting, based on evidence from clinical studies, including the phase 3a PIONEER program, and the authors' clinical experience.

T1  - Resistance Exercise Versus Aerobic Exercise Combined with Metformin Therapy in the Treatment of type 2 Diabetes: A 12-Week Comparative Clinical Study.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Both exercise and metformin are used to control blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while no previous studies have investigated the effect of resistance exercise combined with metformin versus aerobic exercise with metformin in T2DM patients., OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to compare the effects of resistance exercise combined with metformin versus aerobic exercise with metformin in T2DM patients., METHODS: A total of fifty-seven T2DM patients with a mean age of 46.2+/-8.3 years were randomized to three study groups; each group included nineteen patients. The first group conducted a resistance exercise program (REP, 50-60% of 1RM, for 40-50 min) combined with metformin, the second group conducted an aerobic exercise program (AEP, 50-70% maxHR, for 40-50 min) combined with metformin, and the third group received only metformin without exercise intervention (Met group). The study program was conducted thrice weekly for consecutive twelve weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were evaluated before and after study intervention., RESULTS: Significant differences were reported after the 12-week intervention inter-groups in the outcome variables (p<0.05). FBG, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, and VO2max improved significantly in the REP group (p<0.001) and also in the AEP group (p=0.016, p=0.036, p=0.024, and p=0.019 respectively) while the Met group showed an only significant reduction in FBG (p=0.049), and non-significant changes in HbA1c, HOMA-IR, and VO2max (p>0.05). REP group achieved greater improvements than AEP group (FBG, p=0.034; HbA1c%, p=0.002; HOMA-IR, p<0.001; and VO2max, p=0.024)., CONCLUSION: Both resistance and aerobic exercise programs combined with metformin are effective in controlling T2DM. Resistance exercise combined with metformin is more effective than aerobic exercise combined with metformin in the treatment of T2DM.

T1  - [The efficacy and safety of insulin degludec versus insulin glargine in insulin-naive subjects with type 2 diabetes: results of a Chinese cohort from a multinational randomized controlled trial].
N2  - Objective: To compare the safety and efficacy of insulin degludec (IDeg) with those of insulin glargine (IGlar) in insulin-naive subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Methods: This was a 26-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, treat-to-target trial in 560 Chinese subjects with T2DM (men/women: 274/263, mean age 56 years, mean diabetes duration 7 years) inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Subjects were randomized 2:1 to once-daily IDeg (373 subjects) or IGlar(187 subjects), both in combination with metformin. The primary endpoint was changes from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin(HbA1c) after 26 weeks. Results: Mean HbA1c decreased from 8.2% in both groups to 6.9% in IDeg and 7.0% in IGlar, respectively. Estimated treatment difference (ETD) of IDeg-IGlar in change from baseline was -0.10% points (95%CI-0.25-0.05). The proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c<7.0% was 56.3%and 49.7% with IDeg and IGlar, respectively [estimated odds ratio of IDeg/IGlar: 1.26(95%CI 0.88-1.82)]. Numerically lower rateof overall confirmed hypoglycaemia and statistically significantly lower nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia were associated with IDeg compared with IGlar, respectively [estimated rateratio of IDeg/IGlar 0.69(95%CI 0.46-1.03), and 0.43(95%CI 0.19-0.97)]. No differences in other safety parameters were found between the two groups. Conclusions: IDeg was non-inferior to IGlar in terms of glycaemic control, and was associated with a statistically significantly lower rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia. IDeg is considered to be suitable for initiating insulin therapy in Chinese T2DM patients on OADs requiring intensified treatment. Clinical trail registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01849289.

T1  - Baseline Characteristics of Randomized Participants in the Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE).
N2  - OBJECTIVE: GRADE (Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) is a 36-center unmasked, parallel treatment group, randomized controlled trial evaluating four diabetes medications added to metformin in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We report baseline characteristics and compare GRADE participants to a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohort., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were age >=30 years at the time of diagnosis, with duration of T2DM <10 years, HbA1c 6.8-8.5% (51-69 mmol/mol), prescribed metformin monotherapy, and randomized to glimepiride, sitagliptin, liraglutide, or insulin glargine., RESULTS: At baseline, GRADE's 5,047 randomized participants were 57.2 +/- 10.0 years of age, 63.6% male, with racial/ethnic breakdown of 65.7% white, 19.8% African American, 3.6% Asian, 2.7% Native American, 7.6% other or unknown, and 18.4% Hispanic/Latino. Duration of diabetes was 4.2 +/- 2.8 years, with mean HbA1c of 7.5 +/- 0.5% (58 +/- 5.3 mmol/mol), BMI of 34.3 +/- 6.8 kg/m2, and metformin dose of 1,944 +/- 204 mg/day. Among the cohort, 67% reported a history of hypertension, 72% a history of hyperlipidemia, and 6.5% a history of heart attack or stroke. Applying GRADE inclusion criteria to NHANES indicates enrollment of a representative cohort with T2DM on metformin monotherapy (NHANES cohort average age, 57.9 years; mean HbA1c, 7.4% [57 mmol/mol]; BMI, 33.2 kg/m2; duration, 4.2 +/- 2.5 years; and 7.2% with a history of cardiovascular disease)., CONCLUSIONS: The GRADE cohort represents patients with T2DM treated with metformin requiring a second diabetes medication. GRADE will inform decisions about the clinical effectiveness of the addition of four classes of diabetes medications to metformin. Copyright Â© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

T1  - Linagliptin, when compared to placebo, improves CD34+ve endothelial progenitor cells in type 2 diabetes subjects with chronic kidney disease taking metformin and/or insulin: a randomized controlled trial.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial Progenitor cells (EPCs) has been shown to be dysfunctional in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to poor regeneration of endothelium and renal perfusion. EPCs have been shown to be a robust cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk indicator. Cellular mechanisms of DPP4 inhibitors such as linagliptin (LG) on CVD risk, in patients with T2DM with established CKD has not been established. Linagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor when added to insulin, metformin or both may improve endothelial dysfunction in a diabetic kidney disease (DKD) population., METHODS: 31 subjects taking metformin and/or Insulin were enrolled in this 12 weeks, double blind, randomized placebo matched trial, with 5 mg LG compared to placebo. Type 2 diabetes subjects (30-70 years old), HbA1c of 6.5-10%, CKD Stage 1-3 were included. CD34+ cell number, migratory function, gene expression along with vascular parameters such as arterial stiffness, biochemistry, resting energy expenditure and body composition were measured. Data were collected at week 0, 6 and 12. A mixed model regression analysis was done with p value < 0.05 considered significant., RESULTS: A double positive CD34/CD184 cell count had a statistically significant increase (p < 0.02) as determined by flow cytometry in LG group where CD184 is SDF1a cell surface receptor. Though mRNA differences in CD34+ve was more pronounced CD34- cell mRNA analysis showed increase in antioxidants (superoxide dismutase 2 or SOD2, Catalase and Glutathione Peroxidase or GPX) and prominent endothelial markers (PECAM1, VEGF-A, vWF and NOS3). Arterial stiffness measures such as augmentation Index (AI) (p < 0.04) and pulse wave analysis (PWV) were improved (reduced in stiffness) in LG group. A reduction in LDL: HDL ratio was noted in treatment group (p < 0.04). Urinary exosome protein examining podocyte health (podocalyxin, Wilms tumor and nephrin) showed reduction or improvement., CONCLUSIONS: In DKD subjects, Linagliptin promotes an increase in CXCR4 expression on CD34 + progenitor cells with a concomitant improvement in vascular and renal parameters at 12 weeks.

T1  - Precision Medicine in Type 2 Diabetes: Using Individualized Prediction Models to Optimize Selection of Treatment.
N2  - Despite the known heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes and variable response to glucose lowering medications, current evidence on optimal treatment is predominantly based on average effects in clinical trials rather than individual-level characteristics. A precision medicine approach based on treatment response would aim to improve on this by identifying predictors of differential drug response for people based on their characteristics and then using this information to select optimal treatment. Recent research has demonstrated robust and clinically relevant differential drug response with all noninsulin treatments after metformin (sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [DPP-4] inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors) using routinely available clinical features. This Perspective reviews this current evidence and discusses how differences in drug response could inform selection of optimal type 2 diabetes treatment in the near future. It presents a novel framework for developing and testing precision medicine-based strategies to optimize treatment, harnessing existing routine clinical and trial data sources. This framework was recently applied to demonstrate that "subtype" approaches, in which people are classified into subgroups based on features reflecting underlying pathophysiology, are likely to have less clinical utility compared with approaches that combine the same features as continuous measures in probabilistic "individualized prediction" models.

T1  - Effects of metformin exposure on neurodegenerative diseases in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
N2  - Epidemiological evidence reveals that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including dementia and Parkinson's disease (PD). The effects of metformin exposure on dementia and PD risk in patients with T2DM are unknown. We evaluated the effects of metformin exposure on the risk of dementia and PD in patients with T2DM. We performed a cohort study by using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. We recruited 4651 patients in the metformin cohort and a comparable number of nonmetformin controls by using propensity score matching. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the effects of metformin on the risk of dementia and PD after adjustment for several confounding factors. During the 12-year follow-up, the metformin cohort exhibited a higher risk of PD than the nonmetformin cohort (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.68-3.07). The metformin cohort had an increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR: 1.66, 95% CI=1.35-2.04). Moreover, metformin exposure increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR: 2.13, 95% CI=1.20-3.79) and vascular dementia (HR: 2.30, 95% CI=1.25-4.22). The effects of exposure duration and dosage on dementia and PD occurrence were also observed. Long-term metformin exposure in patients with T2DM may lead to the development of NDs, including dementia and PD. Additional large-scale, prospective controlled trials are required to confirm the observed association in patients with T2DM. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Dorzagliatin monotherapy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes: a dose-ranging, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Glucokinase acts as a glucose sensor in the pancreas and a glucose processor in the liver, and has a central role in glucose homoeostasis. Dorzagliatin is a new, dual-acting, allosteric glucokinase activator that targets both pancreatic and hepatic glucokinases. Dorzagliatin has good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in humans, and provides effective 24-h glycaemic control and improves glucose sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dorzagliatin monotherapy at different doses in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes., METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study, we randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) patients to receive oral placebo or one of four doses of oral dorzagliatin (75 mg once a day, 100 mg once a day, 50 mg twice a day, or 75 mg twice a day) using permuted-block randomisation, with a block size of ten and without stratification. Eligible patients were men or non-fertile women (aged 40-75 years) with type 2 diabetes who had a BMI of 19.0-30.0 kg/m2, were on a diet and exercise regimen, and were previously untreated or treated with metformin or alpha-glucosidase inhibitor monotherapy. The study started with a 4-week placebo run-in period followed by a 12-week treatment period. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12, which was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had both baseline and at least one post-baseline HbA1c value. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02561338., FINDINGS: Between Sept 29, 2015, and Aug 17, 2016, we randomly assigned 258 patients to one of the five study groups. At the end of 12 weeks, the least squares mean change in HbA1c from baseline was -0.35% (95% CI -0.60 to -0.10) in the placebo group, -0.39% (-0.64 to -0.14) in the 75 mg once daily group, -0.65% (-0.92 to -0.38) in the 100 mg once daily group, -0.79% (-1.06 to -0.52) in the 50 mg twice daily group, and -1.12% (-1.39 to -0.86) in the 75 mg twice daily group. Compared with the placebo group, the change in HbA1c between baseline and 12 weeks was significant in the 50 mg twice daily (p=0.0104) and the 75 mg twice daily (p<0.0001) groups. The number of adverse events was similar between the treatment groups and the placebo group. There were no reports of drug-related serious adverse events or severe hypoglycaemia., INTERPRETATION: Dorzagliatin had a beneficial effect on glycaemic control and was safe and well tolerated over 12 weeks in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes., FUNDING: Hua Medicine, National Major Scientific and Technological Special Project for Significant New Drugs Development, Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Action Project, Shanghai Pudong District Science and Technology Innovation Action Project, and Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatisation Innovation Action Project.

T1  - Effect of Metformin on Testosterone Levels in Male Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treated With Insulin.
N2  - Aim: To explore the chronic effects of metformin on testosterone levels in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)., Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a real-world study evaluating the efficacy and safety of premixed insulin treatment in patients with T2DM via 3-month intermittent flash glucose monitoring. Male patients aged 18-60 who were using metformin during the 3-month study period were included as the metformin group. The control group included males without metformin therapy by propensity score matching analysis with age as a covariate. Testosterone levels were measured at baseline and after 3-month treatment., Results: After 3-month treatment, the control group had higher levels of total testosterone, free and bioavailable testosterone than those at baseline (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the change of total (-0.82 +/- 0.59 vs. 0.99 +/- 0.59 nmol/L) and bioavailable (-0.13 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.16 nmol/L) testosterone levels in the metformin group significantly decreased (P=0.036 and 0.029, respectively). In Glycated Albumin (GA) improved subgroup, the TT, FT, and Bio-T levels in the control subgroup were higher than their baseline levels (P < 0.05). Compared with the metformin subgroup, TT level in the control subgroup also increased significantly (P=0.044). In GA unimproved subgroup, the change of TT level in the metformin subgroup was significantly lower than that in the control subgroup (P=0.040)., Conclusion: In men with T2DM, 3-month metformin therapy can reduce testosterone levels, and counteract the testosterone elevation that accompanied with the improvement of blood glucose., Clinical Trial Registration: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04847219?term=04847219&draw=2&rank=1.

T1  - Real-world Evaluation of glycemic control and hypoglycemic Events among type 2 Diabetes mellitus study (REEDS): a multicentre, cross-sectional study in Thailand.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often experience hypoglycaemia and weight gain due to treatment side effects. Sulfonylureas (SU) and the combination of SU and metformin (SU+MET) were the most common monotherapy and combination therapies used in Thailand tertiary care hospitals. This study aimed to assess the glycaemic goal attainment rates, hypoglycaemic episodes, weight gain and treatment compliance among patients with T2DM receiving SU or SU+MET., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A multicentre cross-sectional survey and retrospective review was conducted in five tertiary care hospitals, Thailand. Patients with T2DM aged >=30 years were included consecutively during a 12-month period. Glycaemic control, experiences of hypoglycaemia, weight gain and compliance were evaluated. Glycaemic goal attainment was defined by HbA1c level less than 7%., RESULTS: Out of the 659 patients (mean age (+/-SD)), 65.5 (10.0) years and median duration of T2DM (IQR), 10 (5-15) years), 313 (47.5%) achieved the glycaemic goal. HbA1c levels in the patients with goal attainment was significantly lower compared with those without (6.3%+/-0.5% vs 8.1%+/-1.2%, p<0.001). Goal attainment was significantly lower among patients treated with SU+MET than those treated with SU alone (43.5% vs 63.0%; OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31, 0.66, p<0.001). A third of patients reported experiencing hypoglycaemia (30.7%) and weight gain (35.4%). Weight gain in the SU+MET group was lower than those receiving SU alone (33.1% vs 44.6%, p=0.015), but there was no difference in hypoglycaemic events. Major events in the previous 12 months were experienced by 68 patients, most commonly congestive heart failure and ischaemic heart disease. Approximately half of the patients (52.2%) reported not always taking their medication as prescribed., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with T2DM receiving SU or SU+MET, only about half of the patients achieved glycaemic goal and compliance with the treatment. Hypoglycaemia and weight gain posed a significant burden with risk of weight gain higher in the SU group. Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

T1  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor versus metformin as first-line therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a multi-institution database study.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) has shown evidence of cardiovascular benefit in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Currently metformin is the guideline-recommended first-line treatment. We aimed to investigate the benefit of SGLT2i vs metformin as first-line therapy., METHODS: Electronic medical records from Chang Gung Research Database during 2016-2019 were retrieved for patients with T2DM. Patients aged < 20, not receiving anti-diabetic medication, first-line treatment neither metformin nor SGLT2i were excluded. Primary outcomes were heart failure hospitalization, acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality. Patients were followed up for events or December 31, 2019, whichever comes first., RESULTS: After exclusion criteria, a total of 41,020 patients with T2DM were eligible for analysis. There were 1100 patients with SGLT2i as first-line and 39,920 patients with metformin as first-line treatment. IPTW was used for propensity score matching. During one year follow-up, the hazard ratio (HR) of patients on SGLT2i as first-line treatment to patients on metformin as first-line treatment were HR 0.47 (95% CI 0.41-0.54, p < 0.0001) in heart failure hospitalization, HR 0.50 (95% CI 0.41-0.61, p < 0.0001) in acute coronary syndrome, HR 1.21 (95% CI 1.10-1.32, p < 0.0001) in ischemic stroke, and HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.44-0.55, p < 0.0001) in all-cause mortality., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM, SGLT2i as first-line treatment may be associated with decreased events of heart failure hospitalization, acute coronary syndrome, and all-cause mortality, compared with metformin as first-line treatment. However, there may be an increased events of ischemic stroke using SGLT2i compared to metformin.

T1  - Long-Term Complications in Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes.
N2  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in youth is increasing, but little is known regarding the occurrence of related complications as these youths transition to adulthood., METHODS: We previously conducted a multicenter clinical trial (from 2004 to 2011) to evaluate the effects of one of three treatments (metformin, metformin plus rosiglitazone, or metformin plus an intensive lifestyle intervention) on the time to loss of glycemic control in participants who had onset of type 2 diabetes in youth. After completion of the trial, participants were transitioned to metformin with or without insulin and were enrolled in an observational follow-up study (performed from 2011 to 2020), which was conducted in two phases; the results of this follow-up study are reported here. Assessments for diabetic kidney disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and nerve disease were performed annually, and assessments for retinal disease were performed twice. Complications related to diabetes identified outside the study were confirmed and adjudicated., RESULTS: At the end of the second phase of the follow-up study (January 2020), the mean (+/-SD) age of the 500 participants who were included in the analyses was 26.4+/-2.8 years, and the mean time since the diagnosis of diabetes was 13.3+/-1.8 years. The cumulative incidence of hypertension was 67.5%, the incidence of dyslipidemia was 51.6%, the incidence of diabetic kidney disease was 54.8%, and the incidence of nerve disease was 32.4%. The prevalence of retinal disease, including more advanced stages, was 13.7% in the period from 2010 to 2011 and 51.0% in the period from 2017 to 2018. At least one complication occurred in 60.1% of the participants, and at least two complications occurred in 28.4%. Risk factors for the development of complications included minority race or ethnic group, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. No adverse events were recorded during follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Among participants who had onset of type 2 diabetes in youth, the risk of complications, including microvascular complications, increased steadily over time and affected most participants by the time of young adulthood. Complications were more common among participants of minority race and ethnic group and among those with hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

T1  - A Model-Based Meta-Analysis of 24 Antihyperglycemic Drugs for Type 2 Diabetes: Comparison of Treatment Effects at Therapeutic Doses.
N2  - Model-based meta-analysis was used to compare glycemic control, weight changes, and hypoglycemia risk across 24 antihyperglycemic drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes. Electronic searches identified 229 randomized controlled studies comprising 121,914 patients. To ensure fair and unbiased treatment comparisons, the analyses adjusted for important differences between studies, including duration of treatment, baseline glycated hemoglobin, and drug dosages. At the approved doses, glycemic control was typically greatest with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and least with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Weight loss was highly variable across GLP-1RAs but was similar across sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Large weight increases were observed with sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Hypoglycemia risk was highest with sulfonylureas, although gliclazide was notably lower. Hypoglycemia risk for DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones was generally very low but increased slightly for both GLP-1RAs and metformin. In summary, important differences between and within drug classes were identified.

T1  - Healthcare and associated costs related to type 2 diabetes in youth and adolescence: the TODAY clinical trial experience.
N2  - The economic issues related to medical treatments in youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are rarely reported and thus not fully understood. The Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth clinical trial of youth recently diagnosed with T2D collected healthcare and related cost information from the largest cohort studied to date. Costs related to medical treatments and expenses faced by caregivers were identified over a 2-year period from 496 participants. Data were collected by surveys and diaries to document frequency of use of diabetes care (excluding study laboratory tests), non-diabetes care services and treatments, caregiver time, and expenses related to exercise and dietary activities recommended for patients. Economic costs were derived by applying national cost values to the reported utilization frequency data. Annual medical costs in the first year varied by the treatment group, averaging $1798 in those assigned to metformin alone (M), $2971 to combination drug therapy with metformin + rosiglitazone (M + R), and $2092 to metformin + an intensive lifestyle and behavior change program (M + L). Differences were primarily due to costs related to combination drug therapy. Adult caregiver support costs were higher for participants in the lifestyle program, which was delivered in weekly sessions in the first 6 months. Expenses for purchases to enhance diet and exercise change did not vary by treatment assignment. In year 2, medication costs increased in M and M + L due to the initiation of insulin in subjects who failed to maintain glycemic control on the assigned treatment. Data are reported for use by researchers and those providing healthcare to this vulnerable patient population. Copyright Â© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T1  - Association between metformin use and disease progression in obese people with knee osteoarthritis: data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative-a prospective cohort study.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether metformin use was associated with knee cartilage volume loss over 4 years and risk of total knee replacement over 6 years in obese individuals with knee osteoarthritis., METHODS: This study analysed the Osteoarthritis Initiative participants with radiographic knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade >= 2) who were obese (body mass index [BMI] >= 30 kg/m2). Participants were classified as metformin users if they self-reported regular metformin use at baseline, 1-year and 2-year follow-up (n = 56). Non-users of metformin were defined as participants who did not report the use of metformin at any visit from baseline to 4-year follow-up (n = 762). Medial and lateral cartilage volume (femoral condyle and tibial plateau) were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 4 years. Total knee replacement over 6 years was assessed. General linear model and binary logistic regression were used for statistical analyses., RESULTS: The rate of medial cartilage volume loss was lower in metformin users compared with non-users (0.71% vs. 1.57% per annum), with a difference of - 0.86% per annum (95% CI - 1.58% to - 0.15%, p = 0.02), after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, pain score, Kellgren-Lawrence grade, self-reported diabetes, and weight change over 4 years. Metformin use was associated with a trend towards a significant reduction in risk of total knee replacement over 6 years (odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.07-1.30, p = 0.11), after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, Kellgren-Lawrence grade, pain score, and self-reported diabetes., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that metformin use may have a beneficial effect on long-term knee joint outcomes in those with knee osteoarthritis and obesity. Randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and determine whether metformin would be a potential disease-modifying drug for knee osteoarthritis with the obese phenotype.

T1  - Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Type 2 Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis.
N2  - Objective: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have reported promising results. Despite this, there has been limited evidence of its efficacy in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This meta-analysis examined existing evidence on the efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus., Methods: Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for articles discussing the efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Values of standardized mean differences (SMD) and risk ratio (RR) were determined for continuous outcomes and dichotomous outcomes respectively., Results: 8 studies involving 1,454 patients from 5 randomized controlled trials and 3 cohort studies were included in the analysis. Our analysis found significant improvements in hepatic fat content, liver biochemistry, body composition, glucose parameters, lipid parameters, insulin sensitivity and inflammatory markers following glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist treatment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists significantly decreased hepatic fat content compared to metformin and insulin-based therapies. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists also improved fibrosis markers, but this did not reach statistical significance., Conclusion: With a high prevalence of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist treatment shows promise in improving both diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease phenotype.

T1  - Should metformin still be the first-line of treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus? A comprehensive review and suggested algorithm.
N2  - For more than a century, the high occurrences of coronary and peripheral artery diseases in diabetes mellitus patients has been well recognised; despite that, the ability to improve CV event rates by optimizing glycaemic control has remained elusive. Nevertheless, the last decade has seen several cardiovascular outcome clinical trials (CVOTs) of many antihyperglycemic agents that reported promising results for cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This leads to a hot debate on the ideal drug choice for first-line treatment in T2DM. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence supporting the use of metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and incretin-based therapies for the management of individuals with T2DM and, discuss the rationale for selection.

T1  - The present and future treatment of pediatric type 2 diabetes.
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in children and adolescents is particularly challenging. Metformin monotherapy is the standard initial treatment for youth with T2D, once metabolic control is restored with insulin in patients who present with ketosis and/or marked hyperglycemia. Insulin, the only other drug approved for use in youth with T2D, is also used as add-on therapy when patients fail metformin mono-therapy., AREAS COVERED: In this paper, we will summarize the current use of both metformin and insulin in the treatment of pediatric type 2 diabetes, as well as comment on their limitations. Given the rapid progression of T2D in youth, there is also considerable interest in treating youth with new oral and injectable agents that have been approved for use in adults with T2D. The potential for improving clinical outcomes of each of the main classes of new drugs for the treatment of pediatric T2D will be summerized., EXPERT COMMENTARY: We will conclude by reviewing why phase 3 randomized clinical trials examining the safety and efficacy of these medications in the pediatric population have been difficult to complete and discuss a potential pathway to overcome these obstacles to regulatory approval for these drugs for adolescents with T2D.
